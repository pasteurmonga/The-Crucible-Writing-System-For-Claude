> **How Context Works**: This root CLAUDE.md loads at session start.
> Subdirectory CLAUDE.md files (in `planning/`, `outline/`, `draft/`) load
> lazily when Claude reads files in those directories. The story bible and
> style profile are queried on-demand, not auto-loaded. Use `/compact` during
> long sessions to reclaim context space.
