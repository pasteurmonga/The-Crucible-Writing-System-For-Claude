# Outline Phase Context

This CLAUDE.md loads when you access the outline/ directory.

## Outline Documents

When working in the outlining phase, the following documents are available:

### Master Structure
- `master-outline.md` - Full book outline with all 36 beats mapped to chapters

### Chapter Details
- `chapter-summaries.md` - One-paragraph summary per chapter
- `scene-breakdown.md` - Scene-by-scene breakdown for each chapter

### Continuity Tracking
- `foreshadowing-tracker.md` - Plants and payoffs across the book
- `character-threads.md` - Character arcs and development beats

## How to Load

Do NOT load all outline documents at once. Load strategically:

1. **When outlining a new chapter**: Read only that chapter's section from `master-outline.md`
2. **When checking continuity**: Read `foreshadowing-tracker.md` for specific threads
3. **When reviewing character arc**: Read relevant sections from `character-threads.md`

## Outlining Rules

- One chapter outline at a time
- Each chapter outline must include: beats, scenes, plants, payoffs
- Save completed outlines to outline-state.json
- Do not begin writing until outline is complete
