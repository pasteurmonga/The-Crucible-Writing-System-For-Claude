## Forge Point Placement Rules

**Every Forge Point chapter MUST:**
1. Have all three strands in simultaneous crisis
2. Require a sacrifice (one strand suffers to save others)
3. Create irreversible change
4. End with forward momentum

**Forge Point chapters should NOT:**
- Be combined with other major beats
- Include extensive world-building
- Introduce new characters
- End on a quiet note

## Strand Rotation Check

After mapping, verify:
- No strand goes 3+ consecutive chapters without being primary
- Each movement maintains the expected strand pattern (see Crucible structure)
- Forge Points interrupt strand sequences appropriately
