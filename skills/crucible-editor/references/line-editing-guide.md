# Line Editing Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity First** — Reader should understand on first pass
2. **Economy** — Every word earns its place
3. **Rhythm** — Sentences flow and vary
4. **Voice** — Author's style preserved and enhanced

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Filter Words

Remove words that distance reader from experience:

**Before:** She felt the cold wind bite her face.
**After:** The cold wind bit her face.

Common filters: felt, saw, heard, noticed, realized, wondered, thought, seemed, appeared

### Weak Verbs + Adverbs

Replace adverb+weak verb with strong verb:

**Before:** He walked quickly across the room.
**After:** He strode across the room.

**Before:** She said quietly.
**After:** She whispered.

### Passive Voice

Convert to active unless passive serves purpose:

**Before:** The door was opened by the guard.
**After:** The guard opened the door.

Keep passive for: emphasis on receiver, unknown actor, formal/distant tone

### Redundancy

Cut repeated information:

**Before:** She shrugged her shoulders.
**After:** She shrugged.

**Before:** He nodded his head in agreement.
**After:** He nodded.

### Show vs Tell

Convert emotional telling to showing:

**Before:** She was angry.
**After:** Her hands clenched at her sides.

**Before:** He felt nervous.
**After:** He tugged at his collar.

### Dialogue Tags

Simplify where possible:

**Before:** "I can't believe it," she exclaimed loudly.
**After:** "I can't believe it."

Use "said/asked" primarily. Action beats replace tags.

### Stage Directions

Cut unnecessary physical choreography:

**Before:** He stood up from the chair, walked to the window, and looked out.
**After:** At the window, he stared at the empty street.

### Sentence Variety

Mix lengths and structures:

**Monotonous:** He walked to the door. He opened it slowly. He stepped outside. The night was cold.

**Varied:** He walked to the door and opened it slowly. Outside, the night waited, cold and still.

## Paragraph Craft

### Opening Sentences
- Ground reader in POV and setting
- Avoid starting too many paragraphs with "He/She"
- Vary entry points: action, dialogue, thought, sensation

### Transitions
- Last sentence should lead to next paragraph
- Use spatial/temporal/logical connectors
- White space for scene breaks, not paragraph breaks

### Length Variation
- Short paragraphs for impact/action
- Longer paragraphs for reflection/description
- Single-line paragraphs sparingly for emphasis

## Dialogue Craft

### Subtext
- Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- Tension between what's said and meant
- Let reader infer from context

### Voice Distinction
- Vocabulary level varies by character
- Speech patterns unique (short/long sentences, favorite words)
- Cultural/regional markers where appropriate

### Beats and Tags
- Action beats show character while attributing dialogue
- "Said" is invisible—use it
- Avoid "said" synonyms: opined, queried, exclaimed
- Dialogue can stand alone if speaker clear

## Scene-Level Checks

For each scene, verify:
- [ ] Clear POV established immediately
- [ ] Setting grounded without overloading
- [ ] Goal/conflict/outcome present
- [ ] Entry hook and exit momentum
- [ ] Sensory details appropriate to scene type
- [ ] Pacing matches content (action=fast, emotion=slower)
