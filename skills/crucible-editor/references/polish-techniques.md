# Polish Techniques

## Final Refinement Methods

Polish is the last pass—prose should already be structurally sound and grammatically correct. Focus on micro-level improvements that elevate the writing.

## Sentence-Level Polish

### Opening Sentences

Each chapter's first sentence should:
- Hook immediately
- Establish tone
- Ground in POV
- Avoid "It was" or "There was" constructions

**Weak:** It was a dark night when she arrived.
**Strong:** She arrived to darkness and the smell of smoke.

### Closing Sentences

Each chapter's last sentence should:
- Create forward momentum
- Leave a question or image
- Avoid wrapping up too neatly
- Echo theme where appropriate

**Weak:** She went to bed, tired from the day's events.
**Strong:** Sleep, when it came, brought no peace.

### Rhythm and Cadence

**Match rhythm to content:**
- Short, punchy sentences for action
- Longer, flowing sentences for reflection
- Fragments for emphasis
- Vary structure to avoid monotony

**Example (action):**
> Steel met steel. He ducked. Parried. The blade whistled past his ear.

**Example (reflection):**
> The morning light crept through the window, painting golden bars across the floor where she had stood just hours before, when everything had still been possible.

### Word Choice Refinement

**Specific over generic:**
- Not "tree" but "oak" or "willow"
- Not "walked" but "strode" or "shuffled"
- Not "said angrily" but "snarled"

**Period-appropriate vocabulary:**
- Avoid modern slang in historical/fantasy settings
- Match character education level
- Consider regional variations

**Sound and texture:**
- Hard consonants for harsh content
- Soft sounds for gentle scenes
- Alliteration sparingly for effect

## Paragraph-Level Polish

### Transitions

Smooth connections between paragraphs:
- Spatial: "Across the room..."
- Temporal: "Later that night..."
- Logical: "Yet..."
- Echo: Pick up word/image from previous paragraph

### White Space

Use paragraph breaks strategically:
- For emphasis
- For shift in thought
- For beat/pause
- For scene micro-tension

**Overwritten:**
> He opened the door. The room was empty, which surprised him because he had expected to find her there waiting.

**With white space:**
> He opened the door.
>
> Empty.

### Paragraph Length Variation

- Long paragraphs for immersion
- Short paragraphs for impact
- Single lines for maximum punch
- Mix to create reading rhythm

## Scene-Level Polish

### Sensory Balance

Check each scene for sensory engagement:
- Visual (most common—don't over-rely)
- Auditory
- Tactile
- Olfactory
- Taste (rare but memorable)

### Emotional Resonance

At key emotional beats:
- Show physical manifestation
- Use environment to mirror emotion
- Let dialogue reveal through subtext
- Trust reader—don't over-explain

### Micro-Pacing

Within scenes, control pace through:
- Sentence length
- Paragraph length
- Amount of interiority
- Dialogue vs. action ratio
- Detail density

## Read-Aloud Test

Final polish should include reading aloud to catch:
- Awkward phrasing
- Unintentional rhymes
- Tongue-twisters
- Rhythm problems
- Missing beats
- Overwritten passages
