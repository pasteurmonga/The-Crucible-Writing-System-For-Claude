# Crucible Structure Rules

## The 36-Beat Framework

The Crucible Structure is a narrative framework with 36 beats across five movements, weaving three strands:

- **Quest Strand** - External mission/goal
- **Fire Strand** - Internal power/transformation
- **Constellation Strand** - Relationships/community

## Beat Requirements

### Non-Negotiable Rules
- All 36 beats must appear in the manuscript
- Beats must occur in approximate sequence
- Each strand must be represented in every movement
- Forge Points are structural anchors that cannot be moved

### Forge Points

Five critical convergence moments where all three strands collide:

1. **Ignition Forge Point** (~10%) - Catalyst that launches all three strands
2. **First Crucible** (~25%) - First major crisis, all strands in tension
3. **Second Crucible** (~50%) - Midpoint crisis, major sacrifice
4. **Third Crucible** (~75%) - Dark night, all seems lost
5. **Apex Willed Surrender** (~90%) - Climactic convergence

### Forge Point Requirements
Each Forge Point must have:
- [ ] Quest Strand in crisis
- [ ] Fire Strand in crisis
- [ ] Constellation Strand in crisis
- [ ] Clear sacrifice made
- [ ] Irreversible change
- [ ] Forward momentum into next movement

## Movement Structure

### Movement IV: Brightest Burning (Beats 23-28)

- Ends with Third Crucible

### Movement V: Final Forging (Beats 29-34)
- Quest climax approaches

- Constellation restored/transformed
- Mercy payoffs begin
- Ends with Apex Willed Surrender

### Coda (Beats 35-36)

## Review Triggers

### Bi-Chapter Reviews
- Occur every 2 chapters during drafting
- All 5 agents must complete before proceeding
- Critical issues block progress until resolved

### Review Coverage
- Voice consistency across chapters
- Continuity with story bible
- Adherence to chapter outline
- Timeline logic
- Prose craft quality

## Mercy Engine

### The Four Mercies
Each story requires four acts of mercy by the protagonist:
1. Early mercy (Movement I-II)
2. Mid mercy (Movement II-III)
3. Late mercy (Movement III-IV)
4. Final mercy (Movement IV-V)

### Mercy Rules
- Must cost the protagonist something
- Recipient must seem undeserving at the time
- Must pay off in the climax
- Payoffs create "unexpected agents" - helpers that turn the tide
