# Crucible Planner

An interactive planning system for epic fantasy novels using the Crucible Structure.

## Overview

The Crucible Planner transforms a simple story premise into seven comprehensive planning documents through a guided multi-choice question process. It's the first phase of the Crucible Writing System.

## When to Use

## What It Creates

The planner generates **7 interconnected planning documents**:

### 1. Crucible Thesis

## Phase 1: Intake

### What the Planner Needs

At minimum, provide:
- A core concept (1-2 sentences)
- A protagonist sketch (who they are)
- A central conflict hint (what's at stake)

### Example Premise

> "A young blacksmith discovers she's the last descendant of an ancient line of demon-slayers, but the power she's inherited is slowly killing her. She must find a way to destroy the Demon King before the power destroys her—or accept the demon's offer to remove the curse in exchange for her loyalty."

### Scope Confirmation

The planner will ask:

**Target novel length:**
- A) Standard (100-150K words) — ~20-25 chapters
- B) Epic (150-250K words) — ~25-35 chapters
- C) Extended (250K+ / series) — 35+ chapters

**Narrative complexity:**
- A) Single protagonist focus
- B) Dual protagonists
- C) Ensemble cast (3-5 POVs)

---

## Phase 2: Questioning

### Question Format

All questions use multi-choice format:

```

[Context from previous answers]

**[Question]**
A) [Option with brief explanation]
B) [Option]
C) [Option]
D) [Option]
E) Other (describe)
```

### Answering Questions

## Tips for Best Results

### Before Starting

1. **Have a premise ready** — Even a rough idea helps
2. **Know your protagonist** — At least a basic sense of who they are
3. **Consider your theme** — What truth do you want to explore?

### During Questioning

1. **Don't overthink** — First instinct is often right
2. **Use "Other" freely** — The options are starting points, not limits
3. **Build on previous answers** — Coherence matters more than perfection
4. **Take breaks** — State saves; you can continue later

### After Completion

1. **Review all documents** — Look for gaps or contradictions
2. **Adjust before outlining** — Easier to fix now than later
3. **Keep documents accessible** — You'll reference them constantly

## Saving and Resuming

### State Management

The planner saves state after every question cluster. If your session breaks:

1. Return to Claude
2. Say "Continue my Crucible planning"
3. Upload your project state if prompted
4. Resume from where you left off

### What's Saved

- All answered questions
- Current position in workflow
- Generated content so far
- Your premise and scope choices

## Integration with Other Skills

### → Crucible Outliner

After planning is complete:
> "Create a chapter outline from my Crucible planning"

The outliner will request your planning documents and transform them into chapter-by-chapter outlines.

### → Crucible Writer

After outlining is complete:
> "Help me write my novel starting from Chapter 1"

The writer will request your outline and begin scene-by-scene drafting.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does planning take?**
A: Typically 2-3 hours for complete planning, but you can spread it across multiple sessions.

**Q: Can I skip questions?**
A: Not recommended. Each question builds the foundation for later documents.

**Q: What if I change my mind about earlier answers?**
A: Tell the planner what you want to change. It can adjust and propagate changes.

**Q: Is this only for epic fantasy?**
A: The Crucible Structure works best for epic fantasy, but can be adapted. The three-strand architecture suits stories with external quests, internal transformation, and relationship dynamics.

**Q: Can I use this for a series?**
A: Yes! The planner handles multi-book series. It will track cross-book elements and help you plan the larger arc.

## Example Session

```
User: I want to plan a cultivation fantasy novel. My protagonist is 
a young farmer who discovers he can absorb the essence of mythical 
beasts, but each absorption changes him, and he's slowly becoming 
something inhuman.

Claude: [Begins intake phase]

Great premise! I can see the Fire strand clearly—the beast absorption 
that transforms him. Let me ask a few questions to establish scope:

**Target novel length:**
A) Standard (100-150K words) — ~20-25 chapters
B) Epic (150-250K words) — ~25-35 chapters
C) Extended (250K+ / series) — 35+ chapters

User: B

Claude: And narrative complexity:

A) Single protagonist focus
B) Dual protagonists
C) Ensemble cast (3-5 POVs)

User: A

Claude: [Moves to Crucible Thesis questions...]

**CRUCIBLE THESIS — Question 1 of 10**

Every Crucible story has an external burden. For your beast-absorber 
protagonist, what form does his burden take?

A) A physical object of power (must be destroyed/protected/delivered)
B) A person who must be saved/stopped/protected
C) Knowledge or truth that must be revealed/concealed
D) A mission or quest that must be completed
E) A position/role the protagonist must fulfill
F) Other (describe)

User: D - He must reach the Celestial Beast at the world's peak before 
a rival cultivator does, because if the rival absorbs it, they'll gain 
the power to enslave all mythical beasts.

Claude: [Records answer, proceeds to next question...]
