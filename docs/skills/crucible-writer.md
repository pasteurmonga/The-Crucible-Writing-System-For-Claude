# Crucible Writer

Transform Crucible outlines into first-draft prose while maintaining style consistency, plot fidelity, and narrative quality.

## Overview

The Crucible Writer is the final phase of the Crucible Writing System. It takes your detailed chapter outlines and writes actual prose, scene by scene, while maintaining your voice, preventing hallucinations, and tracking continuity through a story bible system.

## When to Use

Activate the Crucible Writer when:

- You've completed Crucible outlining
- You're ready to generate prose from your outline
- You want AI assistance with first-draft writing
- You say things like:
  - "Write my novel"
  - "Draft chapter 1"
  - "Start writing from my outline"
  - "Help me write my book"

## Critical Principles

### ⚠️ Context Window is Limited
Never try to hold the entire novel in context. Load only what's needed for the current scene. Save constantly.

### ⚠️ The Outline is Law
Never invent plot points, characters, or events not in the outline. If something seems missing, ASK—don't improvise.

### ⚠️ Style is Sacred
Capture the author's voice early. Maintain it relentlessly. When in doubt, match the sample.

### ⚠️ Save Everything
After every scene, update the story bible and save the draft. Progress must survive session breaks.

## Phase 2: Style Capture

### What Gets Analyzed

**Vocabulary:**
- Register (Formal/Informal/Mixed)
- Density (Sparse/Rich/Purple)
- Unusual word frequency

**Dialogue:**
- Tag style (Minimal/Standard/Elaborate)
- Character voice distinction
- Subtext usage

**Description:**
- Sensory focus (Visual/Auditory/Tactile/Mixed)
- Metaphor density
- Setting integration

**Interiority:**
- Internal monologue frequency
- Emotional showing vs. telling

**Pacing:**
- Scene transitions
- White space usage
- Paragraph rhythm

## Phase 3: Chapter Writing

### Context Loading

For each chapter, the writer loads ONLY:

| Content | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Current chapter outline | What to write |
| Previous chapter summary | Continuity (NOT full text) |
| Active character states | Who's where, what they know |
| Relevant foreshadowing | Plants/payoffs for this chapter |
| Style profile | Voice maintenance |

### Scene-by-Scene Process

For each scene:

```
WRITING: Chapter [X], Scene [Y]

From outline:
- Goal: [scene goal]
- Conflict: [what opposes]
- Turn: [how it shifts]
- Key moments: [listed]
- Plants/Payoffs: [listed]

Writing this scene now...

[PROSE OUTPUT]

Word count: [X,XXX]
Target: [X,XXX]

Continue to next scene? [Y/N]
```

### After Each Scene

1. Show word count
2. Ask if author wants to review
3. Option to revise before continuing
4. Update story bible
5. Save progress

### Chapter Completion

After all scenes:

```
Chapter [X] Complete

Word count: [X,XXX]
Target: [X,XXX]
Status: [Under/On target/Over]

Outline Verification:
- [✓] All required scenes written
- [✓] All key moments included
- [✓] All plants executed
- [✓] All payoffs resolved
- [✓] Chapter turn achieved
- [✓] Ending hook present

Continuity Check:
- [✓] Character states consistent
- [✓] Timeline consistent
- [✓] No new elements invented

Options:
A) Approve and save chapter
B) Review specific scene
C) Revise [specify]
```

## The Story Bible

The story bible is the writer's memory system, tracking everything so you don't need to hold it in context.

### What It Tracks

- **Chapter summaries** — 100-200 words each
- **Character states** — Location, emotional state, knowledge
- **Established facts** — Names, places, rules confirmed
- **Foreshadowing** — Planted (awaiting payoff) and paid off
- **Timeline** — When each chapter occurs
- **Word counts** — Per chapter and running total
- **Invented details** — Flagged for author review

### Story Bible Updates

After EVERY scene:
- Update character locations/states
- Log any new established facts
- Record foreshadowing planted
- Note foreshadowing paid off
- Update word count

After EVERY chapter:
- Write chapter summary
- Record final character states
- Update timeline
- Flag [INVENTED] details
- Save full chapter text

## Anti-Hallucination Protocol

### The Three Laws

**Law 1: If it's not in the outline, don't write it.**
- Every scene goal, conflict, turn must come from outline
- Don't add scenes, characters, backstory, or plot twists

**Law 2: If you're unsure, ask.**
- Uncertainty = ask the author
- Don't guess on names, places, or rules

**Law 3: Flag what you invent.**
- Some invention is necessary (minor details)
- All non-trivial inventions must be marked: `[INVENTED: description]`

### What Needs Flagging

| Needs Flagging | Doesn't Need Flagging |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Named characters (even minor) | Generic descriptions |
| Named locations | Weather (unless plot-relevant) |
| Specific power/magic details | Basic sensory details |
| Dates or time specifics | Dialogue filler |
| Family relationships | |
| Historical events | |
| Organization names | |

### Verification Checkpoints

**Before writing each scene:**
- Do I have the scene outline loaded?
- Do I know the required elements?
- Are there unknowns I need to ask about?

**After writing each scene:**
- Did I include all required elements?
- Did I invent anything significant?
- Does this match what came before?

## Resuming Paused Sessions

When returning to a draft:

```
Loading Draft: [Title]

Last saved: [timestamp]
Chapters complete: [X of Y]
Current chapter: [X], Scene [Y]
Total words: [X,XXX]

Loading story bible and style profile...

Options:
A) Resume from Scene [Y] of Chapter [X]
B) Review what was written in current chapter
C) Jump to different chapter
D) Show story bible state
```

---

## Handling Feedback

### Scene-Level Revision

```
Revising Chapter [X], Scene [Y]...

[Show original]
[Show revision]

Confirm replacement? (Y/N)
```

### Style Adjustment

```
Adjusting style profile...

[Show what's changing]
[Write sample in adjusted style]

Confirm adjustment? (Y/N)
```

### Plot Deviation

If you want to change the outline:

```
⚠️ This differs from the outline. Options:

A) Update the outline to match (recommended)
B) Proceed without updating (may cause issues)
C) Discuss before deciding
```

## Word Count Management

### If Running Short

- Expand sensory details
- Add interiority/reflection
- Lengthen dialogue exchanges
- Add transitional beats

### If Running Long

- Tighten dialogue
- Reduce description density
- Cut redundant beats
- Trust the reader more

## Generated Files

After completion:

```
manuscript/
├── full-manuscript.md       # Complete draft
├── full-manuscript.docx     # Word format
├── chapter-word-counts.md   # Statistics
└── continuity-report.md     # Potential issues
```

---

## Writing Craft Guidelines

### Dialogue

- "Said" and "asked" are invisible—use freely
- Avoid said-bookisms ("exclaimed," "retorted")
- Action beats can replace tags
- Show the gap between what's said and what's meant

### Description

- Don't info-dump; weave details through action
- Match density to tension (high tension = sparse)
- Ground scenes physically (avoid "floating heads")

### POV

- Stay in one head per scene (third limited)
- Show only what POV perceives
- Color description with POV's perspective
- Avoid "POV filtering" (skip "He saw...")

### Pacing

- Short sentences for tension
- Longer sentences for reflection
- Single-line paragraphs for emphasis
- Vary rhythm; avoid pattern-lock

---

## Genre Conventions

### Cultivation Fantasy

- Power progression through defined stages
- Master-student relationships sacred
- Internal energy as tangible presence
- World responds to cultivation

### Epic Fantasy

- World-building woven through action
- Political/social nuance in dialogue
- Balance grand scale with personal moments
- Show hierarchy through address/behavior

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide a good style sample** — Better sample = better prose
2. **Don't skip outline verification** — Catches problems early
3. **Review after each chapter** — Easier to fix now
4. **Trust the story bible** — It's your memory
5. **Flag generously** — Better to flag than to hallucinate

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does writing take?**
A: Varies enormously. A 100K word novel might take 20-40 hours of active writing sessions.

**Q: Can I edit as we go?**
A: Yes, but don't over-edit first drafts. Get words down, then revise.

**Q: What if the writer invents something I like?**
A: Approve it! It enters the story bible and becomes canon.

**Q: Can I change POV mid-book?**
A: Yes, just tell the writer when POV shifts and for which chapters.
