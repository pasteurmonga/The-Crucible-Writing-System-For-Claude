# Getting Started with the Crucible Writing System

A step-by-step guide for first-time users.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, have ready:

1. **A story idea** — Even a rough premise works
2. **Time** — Planning takes 2-3 hours; outlining 1-2 hours
3. **Claude with Crucible skills enabled:**
   - `crucible-planner`
   - `crucible-outliner`
   - `crucible-writer`

## The Three Phases

The Crucible Writing System has three distinct phases. Complete them in order:

```
1. PLANNING ──────► 2. OUTLINING ──────► 3. WRITING
   (2-3 hours)         (1-2 hours)         (varies)
```

## Phase 1: Planning Your Novel

### Step 1: Start the Planner

Tell Claude something like:

> "I want to plan an epic fantasy novel using the Crucible Structure. My premise is: [describe your story idea]"

### Step 2: Answer Scope Questions

Claude will ask about:
- **Novel length:** Standard (100-150K) / Epic (150-250K) / Extended (250K+)
- **Complexity:** Single POV / Dual POV / Ensemble

### Step 3: Work Through the Questions

You'll answer ~60-100 multi-choice questions across 9 document categories:

| Document | Questions | Topics |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Crucible Thesis | 10 | Core elements, theme |
| Quest Strand | 7 | External mission |
| Fire Strand | 7 | Internal power |
| Constellation Strand | 7 | Relationships |
| Forge Points | 20 | Crisis convergences |
| Dark Mirror | 9 | Antagonist |
| Constellation Bible | 12 | Characters |
| Mercy Ledger | 16 | Setup/payoff |
| World Forge | 9 | Setting, magic |

**Tips:**
- Just type the letter (A, B, C, etc.) to answer
- Use "Other" when the options don't fit
- Take breaks—state saves automatically
- Don't overthink; first instinct is often right

### Step 4: Review Your Planning Documents

After completing questions, you'll receive 7 interconnected documents:

- Crucible Thesis
- Strand Maps (3)
- Forge Point Blueprints
- Dark Mirror Profile
- Constellation Bible
- Mercy Ledger
- World Forge

**Review them!** Easier to fix issues now than during outlining.

## Phase 2: Creating Your Outline

### Step 1: Start the Outliner

Once planning is complete, tell Claude:

> "Create a chapter outline from my Crucible planning documents"

Or if starting a new session:

> "I want to outline my book. I have Crucible planning documents."

### Step 2: Upload Planning Documents

The outliner needs at minimum:
- Crucible Thesis
- Strand Maps
- Forge Point Blueprints

### Step 3: Confirm Structure

Claude will propose a chapter structure mapping the 36 beats. Review and confirm or adjust.

**Standard mapping (25 chapters):**
- Movement I: Chapters 1-3
- Movement II: Chapters 4-8
- Movement III: Chapters 9-14
- Movement IV: Chapters 15-20
- Movement V: Chapters 21-24
- Coda: Chapter 25

### Step 4: Outline Each Chapter

For each chapter, you'll define:
- Opening type
- Core scenes
- Key moments
- Chapter turn (ending)

Claude asks multi-choice questions to build the outline.

### Step 5: Review and Add Craft Elements

After chapter skeletons are complete:
- Verify foreshadowing plants and payoffs
- Check pacing and tension curve
- Ensure strand rotation (no strand absent 3+ chapters)

### Step 6: Receive Your Outline Documents

You'll get:
- Master outline
- Chapter summaries
- Scene breakdown
- Foreshadowing tracker
- Individual chapter files

## Phase 3: Writing Your Novel

### Step 1: Start the Writer

When ready to write, tell Claude:

> "Help me write my novel starting from Chapter 1"

Or:

> "I want to start drafting from my Crucible outline"

### Step 2: Provide a Style Sample

The writer needs to learn your voice. Provide either:

**Option A: Existing writing (recommended)**
- 2,000+ words of your prose
- Same genre ideally
- Includes both action and reflection

**Option B: Style preferences**
- Detailed description of desired style
- Reference authors if helpful
- Specific preferences (short sentences, minimal dialogue tags, etc.)

### Step 3: Confirm Style Profile

Claude will analyze your sample and show a style profile. Confirm it captures your voice or request adjustments.

### Step 4: Write Scene by Scene

Claude writes one scene at a time:

1. Shows what it's about to write (goal, conflict, turn)
2. Writes the prose
3. Shows word count
4. Asks if you want to review/continue

### Step 5: Review and Approve

After each scene:
- Review the prose
- Request revisions if needed
- Approve to continue

After each chapter:
- Full verification against outline
- Continuity check
- Save to story bible

### Step 6: Continue Until Complete

Repeat the scene-by-scene process through all chapters.

The writer maintains:
- Your voice (from style profile)
- Continuity (through story bible)
- Fidelity (to outline)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Do I need to use all three skills?**
A: You can stop after any phase. Many writers use just the planner for structure, then write themselves.

**Q: Can I use this for non-fantasy genres?**
A: The Crucible Structure works best for stories with external quests, internal transformation, and relationship dynamics. Epic fantasy is ideal, but it can work for other genres.

**Q: How long does the whole process take?**
A: Planning: 2-3 hours. Outlining: 1-2 hours. Writing: 20-40+ hours depending on length.

### Planning

**Q: What if I don't know my theme yet?**
A: The questions help you discover it. Answer based on instinct; theme often emerges.

**Q: Can I change answers later?**
A: Yes, just tell Claude what you want to change. Earlier answers may need updating.

### Outlining

**Q: Can I deviate from the 36 beats?**
A: The structure is flexible within movements, but the core architecture (5 movements, 4 forge points + apex) should remain.

**Q: What if my story doesn't fit 25 chapters?**
A: The outliner supports 18-chapter (compact), 25-chapter (standard), and 35-chapter (extended) mappings.

### Writing

**Q: What if Claude invents something I like?**
A: Approve it! The [INVENTED] flag is for review, not rejection. Good inventions become canon.

**Q: Can I edit as we go?**
A: Yes, but consider saving heavy editing for revision. First drafts benefit from momentum.

**Q: What if my session breaks mid-chapter?**
A: All progress saves to the story bible. Just resume and Claude will pick up where you left off.

## Tips for Success

### During Planning

1. **Have your premise ready** — Even rough ideas work
2. **Trust the process** — The questions seem detailed but build something coherent
3. **Use "Other" freely** — Options are starting points
4. **Take breaks** — State saves; no need to rush

### During Outlining

1. **Review structure before detailing** — Easier to adjust chapter count early
2. **Be specific with scenes** — Vague outlines lead to vague prose
3. **Track foreshadowing from the start** — Don't leave it for later

### During Writing

1. **Provide a good style sample** — This is crucial for voice matching
2. **Don't skip verification** — Catches problems early
3. **Review after each chapter** — Before the story bible updates
4. **Trust the process** — Scene-by-scene feels slow but maintains quality
