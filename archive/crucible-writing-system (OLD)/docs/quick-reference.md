## The Three Strands

| Strand | Focus | Tracks |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **QUEST** | External | Mission, burden, objective |
| **FIRE** | Internal | Power, curse, transformation |
| **CONSTELLATION** | Relational | Bonds, fellowship, relationships |

## The Five Movements

| # | Movement | % | Beats | Function |
|---|----------|---|-------|----------|
| I | Ignition | 10% | 1-6 | Light the forge; destroy ordinary world |
| II | First Tempering | 20% | 7-14 | Shape through failure; show dark path |
| III | Scattering | 25% | 15-22 | Expand, harden, fragment |
| IV | Brightest Burning | 25% | 23-28 | Master, gather, choose |
| V | Final Forging | 15% | 29-34 | Converge, fail, transcend |
| + | Coda | 5% | 35-36 | Reveal what was made |

## The Five Forge Points

| FP | Location | Purpose | What Burns |
|----|----------|---------|------------|
| **0** | End of I | No return | Ordinary life |
| **1** | End of II | First failure | Progress (one strand) |
| **2** | End of III | Trust broken | Something important |
| **3** | End of IV | Someone dies | A beloved character |
| **Apex** | Mid V | Surrender | Something essential |

**Rule:** All three strands must be in simultaneous crisis. One is sacrificed to save the others.

## Key Mechanics

### Mercy Engine
- **4 mercies** across Movements II-V
- Each must **cost** something
- Each **pays off** in later victory
- Beat 31 (Unexpected Agents) depends on these

### Dark Mirror
- Antagonist must **parallel** protagonist
- Their philosophy must contain **genuine truth**
- Beat 26: They offer a **compelling alternative**
- Defeated through **choices, not power**

### Three Currencies
| Currency | Gained By | Spent On | Lost To |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Power | Training, wins | Quest, combat | Mercy, restraint |
| Humanity | Mercy, bonds | Resisting corruption | Ruthlessness |
| Time | Victories | Everything | Failures |

*Cannot optimize all three.*

2. **Mercy must cost; mercy must pay off** — No free grace
3. **Antagonist = comprehensible dark path** — "Could be me"
4. **Victory through surrender, not strength** — The Apex
5. **Wound becomes gift** — The Coda's purpose
