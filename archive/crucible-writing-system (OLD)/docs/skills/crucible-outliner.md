# Crucible Outliner

Transform Crucible planning documents into detailed chapter-by-chapter outlines with proper narrative craft.

## Overview

The Crucible Outliner is the bridge between planning and writing. It takes your seven planning documents and transforms them into actionable chapter outlines, complete with scene breakdowns, foreshadowing tracking, and pacing verification.

## When to Use

Activate the Crucible Outliner when:

> - F) Other (describe)

### Scene-Level Detail

For each scene within a chapter:

```
SCENE [X.Y]

Goal: What must this scene accomplish?
Conflict: What opposes the goal?
Turn: How does it shift?

Characters present: [List]
Location: [Where]
Tone/Mood: [Description]

Key moments:
- [Moment 1]
- [Moment 2]

Plants/Payoffs:
- Sets up: [future scene]
- Pays off: [previous setup]
```

## Foreshadowing System

### The Plant-Water-Payoff Pattern

Every significant payoff needs:
1. **Plant** — First subtle introduction (reader may not notice)
2. **Water** — Reinforcement (reader registers but doesn't understand significance)
3. **Payoff** — Resolution (reader connects back with satisfaction)

### Required Threads

| Element | Must Plant | Must Payoff |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Each Mercy | The recipient + act | Unexpected Agents (Beat 31) |
| Dark Mirror | Antagonist's philosophy | Final confrontation |
| Fire Mastery | The surrender principle | Mastery moment |
| Core Bond | What makes it unbreakable | Bond That Holds (Beat 27) |
| Betrayal | Cracks in the relationship | The apparent betrayal |
| Sacrifice | Character's willingness to die | The death (Beat 25) |

### Tracking Format

```
Thread: [Description]
├── Plant: Chapter [X], Scene [Y] — [How it's planted]
├── Water: Chapter [X] — [How it's reinforced]
└── Payoff: Chapter [X], Scene [Y] — [How it resolves]
```

## Pacing Verification

### Tension Curve

```
                        FP3 ●
                       /    \        APEX ●
             FP2 ●    /      \      /     \
            /    \  /        \    /       \
    FP1 ●  /      \/          \  /         ●● Coda
   /    \ /                    \/
  /      ●                      
 /       
● Start
```

### Verification Checks

- [ ] Overall tension rises through the book
- [ ] Each Forge Point is a local peak
- [ ] Valleys allow recovery and reflection
- [ ] Apex is the highest tension point
- [ ] Coda provides gentle decline

### Strand Rotation Check

After mapping, verify:
- No strand goes 3+ consecutive chapters without being primary
- Each movement maintains expected strand pattern
- Forge Points interrupt strand sequences appropriately

## Integration with Other Skills

### ← Crucible Planner

The outliner expects planning documents from the planner:
> "Please upload your Crucible Thesis and Strand Maps"

### → Crucible Writer

After outlining is complete:
> "Help me write my novel starting from Chapter 1"

The writer will use your outline to draft scene-by-scene.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Complete planning first** — Don't skip to outlining
2. **Review structure before detailing** — Easier to adjust chapter count now
3. **Be specific with scenes** — Vague outlines lead to vague prose
4. **Track foreshadowing early** — Don't leave it to the craft layer
5. **Verify Forge Points especially** — They're the structural pillars

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should chapter outlines be?**
A: Detailed enough that you (or the writer skill) know exactly what happens, but not so detailed you're writing prose. Scene goals, conflicts, turns, and key moments are essential.

**Q: Can I change the beat-to-chapter mapping?**
A: Yes, but carefully. The proportions ensure proper pacing. Major changes should have good reason.

**Q: What if a beat doesn't fit one chapter?**
A: Some beats span multiple chapters; some chapters contain multiple beats. The mapping is flexible.

**Q: How long does outlining take?**
A: Typically 1-2 hours for a standard book, longer for extended or series books.
