# Chapter 2: The Selection

---

The Selection grounds had been transformed.

Sonny crouched in his hiding spot—a narrow gap between two warehouses that offered a clear view of the central plaza—and watched the nobles prepare for what might be the most important day of their lives.

Banners hung from every surface, silk in colors so rich they seemed to glow in the morning light. A raised platform dominated the center of the plaza, draped in red and gold, with three ornate chairs positioned at its heart. The chairs were empty, waiting.

Everything was waiting.

The noble families had arrived before dawn, staking out positions, establishing their candidates' precedence through subtle wars of placement and posture. Sonny counted at least thirty young cultivators, each one attended by servants, guards, and anxious parents. Their robes were immaculate. Their qi signatures pulsed with carefully cultivated power.

They looked like gods.

They looked like everything Sonny would never be.

*What am I even doing here?*

The question had plagued him since he'd left his rooftop before sunrise, drawn to the Selection grounds by something he couldn't name. He shouldn't be here. Street rats didn't attend noble ceremonies. If anyone noticed him—if any of those cultivators turned their attention toward the shadows where he hid—

But he couldn't stay away.

The want he'd discovered on that rooftop three days ago had sunk its claws into him. It whispered that he needed to see this. Needed to witness what was possible, even if it wasn't possible for him. Needed to understand what he was being denied before he could properly bury the wanting.

So he watched, and he waited, and he told himself he was only here to put the dream to rest.

---

The morning crept past in rituals Sonny didn't understand.

Senior cultivators from local sects arrived to pay respects, each entrance more elaborate than the last. Speeches were given. Blessings were offered. The noble candidates stood in perfect formation, demonstrating their discipline, their breeding, their worthiness to even be considered.

Sonny's legs cramped from his crouching position, but he didn't move. Moving meant risk. Risk meant discovery. Discovery meant—

He didn't want to think about what discovery meant.

A commotion near the plaza's eastern entrance drew his attention. The crowd was parting, creating a corridor through the gathered masses, and Sonny felt something shift in the air. A pressure. A weight. The sense that something significant was approaching.

*They're here.*

His heart hammered against his ribs. He pressed himself deeper into the shadows, making himself as small and invisible as possible, and watched.

---

The first master entered like a joke that had wandered into the wrong venue.

He was... not what Sonny had expected.

The man stumbled through the parted crowd with the graceless weave of someone who'd been drinking since the previous evening. His robes—which might once have been fine—were stained and rumpled. His hair was a disaster. He clutched a wine jug in one hand, sloshing liquid with every unsteady step, and his face wore the slack, happy expression of the professionally inebriated.

*This can't be right.*

Whispers erupted through the crowd. Sonny caught fragments: "Is that—" "It can't be—" "The Laughing Blade?" "He's *drunk*."

The man reached the center of the plaza and stopped, swaying slightly. He blinked at the raised platform, at the ornate chairs, at the noble families frozen in various states of horror and confusion. Then he let out a tremendous belch.

"Wrong party," he announced to no one in particular. "Looking for the other thing. The, uh." He waved vaguely. "The thing with the fighting."

Someone in the crowd laughed—a single, sharp sound that cut off immediately. The silence that followed was absolute.

Sonny stared. This couldn't be Wu Liao. This couldn't be the Sword Saint, the legend whose name was spoken with reverent fear throughout the cultivation world. This was a drunk. A fool. A—

A young man stepped forward from the crowd. Foreign robes, unfamiliar sect markings, a sneer that suggested he'd been waiting for an opportunity exactly like this one.

"Perhaps the honored elder has lost his way," the young man said, his voice pitched to carry. "The wine shops are in the merchant district. Allow me to escort you before you further embarrass yourself."

The drunk blinked at him. "Escort?"

"The Selection is a sacred ceremony." The young man's sneer deepened. "Not a tavern for washed-up old fools to stumble through. Show some respect for the occasion, or—"

He stopped.

Everyone stopped.

Sonny couldn't explain what happened next. One moment, the plaza was full of sound and movement and the young man's arrogant voice. The next, there was nothing. Absolute stillness. Absolute silence.

And cold.

Cold like Sonny had never felt—cold that had nothing to do with temperature. It radiated from the drunk like light from the sun, and everywhere it touched, everything *stopped*. Hearts stopped. Breath stopped. Thought stopped.

Sonny's entire body locked into place. His lungs refused to work. His eyes couldn't blink. He was frozen, trapped, utterly helpless, and some deep animal part of his brain was screaming that he was about to die.

The drunk's face hadn't changed. The slack, happy expression remained. The wine jug still hung from his fingers. But his eyes—

His eyes were ancient. His eyes were death.

"Escort," he repeated, and the word fell into the silence like a stone into still water.

The young man made a sound. It might have been meant to be words. It came out as a whimper—high and thin and utterly stripped of pride.

Then the cold vanished.

Sound rushed back. Movement returned. Sonny gasped, dragging air into lungs that suddenly worked again, and watched the drunk's expression slide back into foolish amiability as if nothing had happened.

"Never mind," the drunk said cheerfully. "Found it. This is the thing." He ambled toward the platform, apparently having already forgotten the young man who stood trembling in his wake.

The young man's legs gave out. He collapsed to his knees, robes pooling around him, face the color of old ash. No one moved to help him. No one even looked at him.

Everyone was watching the drunk climb the steps to the platform, settle into one of the ornate chairs, and take a long drink from his jug.

Wu Liao had arrived.

---

Sonny's hands wouldn't stop shaking.

He'd felt power before. He'd been near cultivators, had sensed their qi, had known on an instinctual level that they could destroy him without effort. But this—

This was different.

Wu had done something with nothing. No technique. No visible power. Just... presence. Just the weight of who he was, pressing down on reality until reality submitted.

*And he did it while acting drunk.*

The thought was terrifying. If that was Wu pretending to be a fool, what was Wu when he wasn't pretending?

Sonny didn't want to know. He wanted to run, to flee back to his rooftops and alleys and forget he'd ever been stupid enough to come here. The wanting that had driven him suddenly seemed like insanity. What had he been thinking? That he could somehow be part of this world? That legends like Wu would ever—

Movement at the plaza's entrance. Another corridor forming through the crowd. Another shift in the air's weight.

*The second one.*

---

She entered like grief given form.

Mei Luo moved through the parted crowd with a grace that made everything around her seem crude by comparison. Her robes were pale lavender, simple, elegant. Her hair was pinned with jade ornaments that caught the light. Her face was beautiful—devastatingly beautiful, the kind of beauty that stopped breath and broke hearts.

But her eyes.

Sonny looked at her eyes, and something cracked in his chest.

She was sad. Not the small, temporary sadness of disappointment or loss. This was something deeper. Something that had carved itself into her features and settled into her bones. She carried sorrow the way other people carried their own names—intrinsically, inseparably, forever.

And yet.

Even from his hiding spot, even at this distance, Sonny felt her presence reach toward him. Not the crushing weight of Wu's killing intent, but something softer. Something that wrapped around his heart and whispered *I understand. I know what it is to hurt. Let me help.*

He wanted to go to her. He wanted to step out of the shadows, cross the plaza, fall at her feet and tell her everything—the loneliness, the invisibility, the terrible wanting that wouldn't let him rest. He wanted her to look at him with those sad, knowing eyes and make it better.

*What is this?*

He'd never felt anything like it. Her presence was like perfume—impossible to ignore, impossible to resist. It pulled at something deep inside him, some wounded part that had never been touched, and it *ached*.

Around the plaza, he could see others reacting the same way. Hard-faced cultivators softening. Proud nobles blinking back unexpected tears. Even Wu, watching from his chair, had lost the foolish expression. He looked at Mei with something that might have been old fondness, or old pain, or both.

She climbed the steps to the platform and took the chair beside Wu. They didn't speak. They didn't need to.

The silence she'd brought was different from Wu's—not the silence of terror, but the silence of reverence. Of awe. Of standing in the presence of something so profound that words would only diminish it.

Sonny realized he was crying.

He wiped his eyes furiously, ashamed. What was wrong with him? He was a street rat. He didn't cry. He'd beaten that weakness out of himself years ago.

But Mei's presence had found the cracks in his armor, had slipped through defenses he'd thought impenetrable, and now he was leaking like a broken vessel.

*Get out,* he told himself. *Get out now, before the third one arrives. Before whatever's happening here gets worse.*

He didn't move.

---

The third entrance was heralded by silence.

Not the enforced silence of Wu's killing intent, or the reverent silence of Mei's presence. This was something else. This was the silence of a storm about to break—the held-breath moment between lightning and thunder.

Xu Sun walked into the plaza, and the world went quiet.

He was tall. Taller than anyone Sonny had ever seen, his frame commanding in a way that had nothing to do with size. His skin was dark as onyx, gleaming in the morning light. His eyes were black, depthless, and they swept across the crowd like daggers looking for targets.

He wore no sword. No weapon of any kind. His robes were severe—black and gray, without ornament or decoration. His hair was shorn close to his skull. Everything about him was stripped down, essential, without a single unnecessary element.

He walked like a king among kings.

No—not a king. Kings had subjects, had courts, had the trappings of authority to prop them up. Xu Sun needed nothing. His authority came from within, absolute and unchallengeable. He walked like what he was: a force of nature wearing human skin.

The crowd didn't part for him the way it had for the others. It wasn't necessary.

People simply stopped existing in his path.

Sonny watched cultivators—powerful cultivators, nobles who'd spent lifetimes building their strength and status—step aside without conscious decision. Their bodies moved before their minds caught up, recognizing on some primal level that standing in Xu Sun's way was not an option.

The third master climbed the steps and took his seat without acknowledging either of his companions. His gaze remained fixed on the crowd, and everywhere it touched, people flinched.

Three chairs. Three masters. Three legends made flesh.

Sonny realized he'd stopped breathing.

---

The Selection began.

A herald stepped forward—some local official, clearly terrified to be standing in front of such powers—and began reciting the ritual words. Something about tradition. Something about honor. Something about the sacred duty of the masters and the humble offerings of the candidates.

Sonny barely heard it. His attention was fixed on the platform, on the three figures seated there, trying to reconcile what he was seeing with what he'd expected.

Wu was drinking again, slumped in his chair, apparently half-asleep. Mei sat with her hands folded in her lap, sadness radiating from her like heat from a fire. Xu hadn't moved, hadn't blinked, hadn't shown any reaction to anything.

They looked... bored.

No—not bored. *Waiting.* The way predators waited. Patient. Alert. Ready.

The first candidate approached the platform.

He was everything Sonny wasn't: tall, handsome, immaculately groomed. His robes cost more than Sonny would steal in a lifetime. When he bowed to the masters, the gesture was perfect—deep enough to show respect, not so deep as to show weakness.

"Chen Wei of the Chen family," the herald announced. "Third generation cultivator of the Azure Path. Foundation establishment at age twelve. Current cultivation: Peak of the Third Realm."

The young man—Chen Wei—straightened and began his demonstration. Sword forms, flowing and precise. Qi manipulation that made the air shimmer. A final technique that sent a blade of pure energy screaming into the sky, where it exploded in a shower of blue-white sparks.

The crowd applauded. The Chen family beamed with pride.

The masters didn't react.

Chen Wei bowed again, deeper this time, clearly hoping for some acknowledgment. Wu took another drink. Mei's expression didn't change. Xu might have been carved from stone.

After a long, uncomfortable moment, Chen Wei retreated. His family's pride had curdled into anxiety.

The next candidate approached.

---

Sonny watched twelve demonstrations.

Each one was impressive. Each candidate was the pride of their family, the culmination of generations of cultivation and breeding and careful investment. They displayed techniques that made the air sing and the ground tremble. They poured their hearts into their performances, desperate to prove themselves worthy.

The masters watched without reaction.

By the fifth demonstration, the crowd had grown restless. By the eighth, whispered conversations had started. By the twelfth, there was open speculation about whether the masters had made some kind of mistake.

"Maybe they're not here for the Selection after all."

"Perhaps this is a test. They're waiting for someone to do something unexpected."

"The Laughing Blade looks half-dead. Do you think he's actually paying attention?"

Sonny had been thinking the same thing. Wu hadn't moved from his slouched position. Mei hadn't stirred. Xu hadn't acknowledged any of the candidates existed.

Whatever they were looking for, they weren't finding it here.

*What are they looking for?*

The thought nagged at him. These were legends—beings so powerful they'd passed into myth. They could have chosen anyone. They could have taken on disciples from the greatest sects, the most prestigious families, the most talented cultivators of the age.

Instead, they'd come here. To Xin Birch. To watch noble children perform techniques that apparently didn't interest them.

*Why?*

The thirteenth candidate finished her demonstration—something involving flames and illusions that drew gasps from the crowd. The masters didn't respond. She retreated, close to tears.

Something was wrong with this Selection. Sonny could feel it. The masters weren't going through the motions of consideration; they weren't even pretending to evaluate the candidates. They were waiting for something else entirely.

But what?

---

The formal demonstrations ended near midday.

Thirty-one candidates had presented themselves. Thirty-one performances ranging from impressive to extraordinary. Thirty-one noble families waiting with bated breath for some sign, some indication, some hint of the masters' preferences.

The masters conferred.

Sonny couldn't hear what they were saying from his hiding spot, but he could see them lean toward each other, exchanging words in low voices. Wu's foolish expression had sharpened slightly. Mei was nodding at something. Xu's stone face showed the first flicker of... something. Disagreement? Interest? Impossible to tell.

The crowd pressed forward, straining to read the outcome from the masters' body language. Parents gripped their children's shoulders. Candidates stood rigid with hope and terror. The air itself seemed to thicken with anticipation.

After what felt like hours—but was probably only minutes—Wu stood.

The plaza fell silent.

"Thank you," he said, and his voice carried without effort, reaching every corner of the grounds. The foolish slur was gone; the drunken stumble had been replaced by absolute stillness. "The candidates have demonstrated... adequately."

Adequately. After thirty-one performances that would have earned places in any sect in the region. Adequately.

The noble families exchanged horrified glances.

"However." Wu's gaze swept across the crowd, and Sonny felt it pass over his hiding spot like a physical touch. "We have not yet seen what we came to see. The Selection is not complete."

Murmurs erupted. The herald stepped forward, confusion plain on his face.

"Honored master, all registered candidates have—"

"Then perhaps," Wu said mildly, "we should look beyond the registered candidates."

The murmurs became shouts. Noble parents demanded explanations. Candidates who'd thought themselves safe suddenly faced a new threat. The careful order of the Selection was crumbling into chaos.

Sonny should have run.

He should have used the confusion to slip away, to return to his territory, to forget this whole mad venture. Whatever the masters were looking for, it had nothing to do with him. It couldn't have anything to do with him. He was a street rat. He was invisible. He was—

Xu Sun was looking at him.

Not toward him. Not in his general direction. *At* him. Those depthless black eyes had found him in his hiding spot, in the shadows between the warehouses, and they held him like pinned prey.

*No.*

Sonny's heart stopped.

*He can't see me. I'm hidden. I'm invisible. I've always been invisible.*

But Xu Sun was still looking.

And then—so slightly that Sonny almost missed it—the master nodded.

---

The chaos continued around him. Noble families arguing, candidates pleading, the herald trying desperately to restore order. But Sonny was frozen, unable to move, unable to breathe, trapped by a single look from an ancient power.

*He saw me.*

The thought kept repeating, drowning out everything else.

*He saw me he saw me he saw me—*

Xu Sun turned away, returning his attention to the crowd. The moment broke. Sonny could move again, could breathe again, could think again—but the cold certainty remained.

He'd been seen.

After a lifetime of invisibility, after years of cultivating his ability to pass unnoticed, a legend had looked into the shadows and found him.

*Did I imagine it?*

He wanted to believe he had. Wanted to tell himself it was coincidence, or paranoia, or exhaustion playing tricks on his mind. Xu hadn't pointed him out. Hadn't called for guards. Hadn't done anything except look.

But that look.

That nod.

They meant something. Sonny didn't know what, but they meant *something*.

On the platform, the masters had returned to their conference. Their voices were too low to hear, but their gestures had become animated. Wu was making some kind of argument. Mei was shaking her head. Xu sat impassive, but something in his posture suggested he was waiting.

Waiting for what?

*For me?*

The thought was absurd. Insane. The kind of desperate fantasy a street orphan would conjure to make his miserable existence feel significant.

But Xu Sun had looked at him. Had nodded. And now the Selection was in chaos because the masters hadn't found what they were looking for among thirty-one noble candidates.

Sonny's legs were shaking. His whole body was shaking. He needed to run. He needed to flee, to disappear, to forget any of this had ever happened.

Instead, he stayed.

He stayed, and he watched, and he waited—just like the masters—for whatever came next.

---

The sun was setting by the time the crowd finally dispersed.

No choice had been made. No candidate had been selected. The masters had simply... stopped. Ended the proceedings without explanation, without announcement, without any indication of what happened next.

The noble families retreated in confusion and fury. Candidates who'd been certain of victory hours ago now faced the nightmare of uncertainty. The Selection, which should have concluded with triumph for one family and dignified defeat for the others, had instead concluded with nothing at all.

Sonny stayed in his hiding spot until the plaza was nearly empty. Only when the last servants were packing away the decorations did he finally allow himself to move.

His legs screamed with cramps. His back ached from hours of crouching. But none of that mattered.

*He saw me.*

The thought had become a mantra, beating against the inside of his skull.

*Xu Sun saw me. One of the three legends looked into the shadows and saw me. And nodded.*

It meant nothing. It had to mean nothing. Sonny was a street rat, invisible by design and necessity. The masters were here for noble candidates, for worthy disciples, for young cultivators with bloodlines and training and potential.

Not for orphans who stole meat buns to survive.

He emerged from his hiding spot on unsteady legs and made his way back toward his territory. The streets of Xin Birch were quiet now, the usual evening bustle subdued by the strange events at the Selection. Even the merchants seemed uncertain, casting glances toward the plaza as if expecting something else to happen.

Sonny climbed to one of his rooftops and sat with his back against a chimney, staring at the stars.

*What am I supposed to do now?*

He didn't know. The Selection would continue tomorrow—that much was certain. The masters hadn't found what they were looking for, which meant they would keep looking. And if Xu Sun had really seen him, really noticed him, really *nodded*...

*Stop it.*

He was building fantasies from nothing. A glance in his direction. A movement that might have been a nod, or might have been anything else. He was seeing meaning where there was none, because the wanting had taken root in his chest and now it was making him stupid.

The masters weren't looking for him. They couldn't be.

But as Sonny lay back on the cold rooftop and stared at the uncaring stars, he couldn't shake the feeling that something had changed. That the ground beneath his feet had shifted. That the walls of his invisible world had developed cracks, and light was beginning to seep through.

*Something is happening.*

He didn't know what. He didn't know if it was good or bad or neither.

But for the first time in his life, Sonny felt like he was standing at the edge of something. Something vast and terrifying and utterly unknown.

The Selection wasn't over.

And neither, he suspected, was his part in it.
