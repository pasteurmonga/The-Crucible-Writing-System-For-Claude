## Grammar Essentials

### Tense Consistency
- Past tense: "She walked to the door."
- Present tense: "She walks to the door."
- Don't shift mid-paragraph unless intentional flashback

### Subject-Verb Agreement
- Singular subjects take singular verbs
- Collective nouns typically singular: "The team is ready."
- Compound subjects with "and" take plural: "Tom and Jerry are here."

### Pronoun Clarity
- Antecedent must be clear
- Avoid: "Tom told Jerry he was wrong." (Who's wrong?)
- Fix: "Tom told Jerry, 'You're wrong.'"

### Comma Usage

**Use commas:**
- After introductory phrases: "In the morning, she left."
- In compound sentences: "She left, and he stayed."
- Around non-essential clauses: "Tom, who was tired, sat down."
- In lists: "apples, oranges, and bananas" (Oxford comma recommended)

**Don't use commas:**
- Between subject and verb: Wrong: "The man, ran."
- Before "that" clauses: Wrong: "She said, that he was wrong."

### Semicolon Usage
- Join related independent clauses: "She left; he stayed."
- In complex lists: "We visited Paris, France; London, England; and Rome, Italy."

### Dash Usage
- Em dash for interruption: "She was—"
- Em dash for emphasis: "He had one goal—revenge."
- En dash for ranges: "pages 10–15"

## Consistency Checks

### Names and Terms
- Spelling consistent throughout
- Capitalization consistent
- Nicknames/titles used consistently

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine (or one through ninety-nine—pick a style)
- Use numerals for larger numbers
- Times: either "three o'clock" or "3:00"—be consistent

### Formatting
- Scene breaks marked consistently
- Chapter headings formatted uniformly
- Dialogue formatting consistent

## Fantasy-Specific Standards

### Made-Up Words
- Consistent spelling of invented terms
- Consistent capitalization (Magic vs magic)
- Consistent pluralization

### Titles and Honorifics
- Capitalize when used as name: "King Arden"
- Lowercase when generic: "the king"
- Consistent throughout

### Magic Systems
- Terminology consistent
- Rules followed per world-building
- Costs/limitations applied consistently

## Dialogue Formatting

### Standard Format
```
"Hello," she said.
"Hello." She smiled.
```

### Interrupted Dialogue
```
"I was just—"
"Don't say it."
```

### Trailing Off
```
"I thought maybe..."
```

### Action Beats
```
"I don't think so." He crossed his arms. "Not today."
```

## Common Errors

### Its vs It's
- Its = possessive: "The cat licked its paw."
- It's = it is: "It's raining."

### Their/There/They're
- Their = possessive: "their house"
- There = location: "over there"
- They're = they are: "they're coming"

### Affect vs Effect
- Affect = verb (usually): "It affected him."
- Effect = noun (usually): "The effect was immediate."

### Lie vs Lay
- Lie = recline (no object): "I lie down."
- Lay = put (needs object): "I lay the book down."
- Past tense of lie = lay: "Yesterday, I lay down."

### Who vs Whom
- Who = subject: "Who did this?"
- Whom = object: "To whom did you give it?"
