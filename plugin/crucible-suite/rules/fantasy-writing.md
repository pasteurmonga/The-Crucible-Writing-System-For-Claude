# Fantasy Writing Rules

## Genre Conventions

### Epic Fantasy Expectations
- Complex magic systems with consistent rules
- Multi-layered world-building that enhances story
- Character growth through adversity
- Themes of good vs evil, with nuance
- High stakes that affect the world

### Prose Guidelines
- Avoid modern idioms in pseudo-medieval settings
- Balance action with introspection
- Use sensory details for immersion
- Show culture through character behavior
- Weave world-building into action, not info-dumps

### Dialogue
- Speech patterns should reflect character background
- Avoid anachronistic expressions
- Formal/informal register should match setting
- Accents and dialects used sparingly and consistently

## Magic System Rules

### Sanderson's First Law
Hard magic (rules known to reader) can solve problems proportionally to how well the reader understands the rules.

### Sanderson's Second Law
Limitations are more interesting than powers. Define what magic CAN'T do.

### Sanderson's Third Law
Expand what you already have before adding something new.

### Cost and Consequence
- All magic should have a cost
- Costs should be meaningful
- Consequences should be consistent
- No unlimited power

## Character in Fantasy

### Protagonist Requirements
- Clear motivation that drives the plot
- Internal conflict that creates growth
- Agency in their own story
- Flaws that create obstacles
- Growth arc that ties to theme

### Supporting Cast
- Each character serves narrative purpose
- Distinct voices and personalities
- Own goals beyond helping protagonist
- Relationships that evolve

### Antagonist Depth
- Believes they are justified
- Has understandable motivation
- Poses genuine threat
- Thematically mirrors protagonist
