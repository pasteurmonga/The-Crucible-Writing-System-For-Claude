# Quest Strand Map: The Memory Forge

## The Burden

**What She Carries:** The last memory-keepers -- living people who must be protected.

**Origin:** Accidental discovery -- she stumbles into their hiding place while fleeing the village attack.

**Why Her:** Her gift can oppose the cult's memory-stealing in a way nothing else can. She is the only counter to the cult's power.

## Movement I: Receiving the Burden (Chapters 1-3)

### The Ordinary World
She is a blacksmith in a small village, restless but trapped. Something feels missing, but village life holds her. She carries a wound -- the loss of someone close (parent, sibling, or friend) -- and believes the lie that she is not worthy of good things.

### Ignition (Forge Point 0)
The cult attacks her village, destroying everything she knows. Her power erupts unbidden during the attack -- terrifying, uncontrolled. She is now marked; her power has been revealed.

### Discovery of the Burden
Fleeing the destruction, she stumbles upon the memory-keepers' hiding place. She learns that the memories they carry contain knowledge that could destroy the cult -- this is why they are hunted.

### First Forge Point
**The Choice:** Save a few keepers or flee to save herself and fight another day.
**The Loss:** Some of the memory-keepers die because she couldn't save everyone.

## Movement II: Carrying the Burden (Chapters 4-6)

### Escalation
Protecting the keepers uncovers something larger -- the cult's plan to reshape all memory. What began as protecting a handful of survivors becomes opposing a conspiracy to rewrite reality itself.

### The Impossible Requirement
The cult leader's mastery of the same power far exceeds hers. She cannot win through strength alone.

### Stakes Rising
Each confrontation reveals more of the cult's reach. The keepers are not just refugees but the last hope for the old ways.

## Movement III: The Weight Increases (Chapters 7-8)

### Hardening
Her ruthless choices have consequences. She has crossed lines -- using someone's memories without consent to gain information or power.

### Second Forge Point
**The Crisis:** Her ruthless choices have driven an ally to betray her.
**The Betrayal:** Her childhood friend turns away from her after seeing what she's become.

### The Conspiracy Revealed
The cult's true plan becomes clear. They don't just want to destroy the memory-keepers -- they want to reshape the collective memory of the world itself.

---

## Movement IV: Resolution (Chapters 9-10)

### Third Forge Point
**The Death:** The mentor sacrifices themselves to save her from the cult leader.
**The Surrender:** She must surrender her pride and self-reliance -- she must ask for help.

### The Apex
To defeat the cult leader, she must surrender her power itself. This breaks the cycle of memory-forging -- no more hunters can be made.

### Resolution
The keepers scatter, each carrying part of the old ways to safety. They are dispersed to rebuild, hidden across the world. The memories survive not in one place but in many.
