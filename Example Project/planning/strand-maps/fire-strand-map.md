# Fire Strand Map: The Memory Forge

## The Fire

**The Gift:** Memory-forging -- she can forge weapons that steal memories.

**The Danger:** Using this power changes her into something other than human. The transformation is not metaphorical but literal.

**The Ultimate Risk:** If she loses control, she becomes like the cult -- transforms into a memory-hunter herself, losing all she fights for.

---

## The Cost

**Each Use Exacts a Price:** Physical change -- her body shows visible signs of transformation. Eyes, skin, something the world can see. Each time she uses the power, she looks less human.

---

## Movement I: Spark (Chapters 1-3)

### First Manifestation
**How It Appears:** Crisis explosion -- the power erupts unbidden during the village attack.

The power comes not from training or choice but from desperate need. It is terrifying, uncontrolled, and saves her life while marking her forever.

### Discovery
She doesn't understand what she did or how. The memory-weapon she created in that moment of terror is her first glimpse of what she might become.

### Early Signs
The first physical changes appear. Small things, easily hidden or explained away. But she knows something is different.

---

## Movement II: Kindling (Chapters 4-6)

### Learning Control
With the mentor's guidance, she begins to understand her power. Each lesson teaches her more about the gift -- and more about the danger.

### The Pattern of All Wielders
**What Happened to Previous Wielders:** All succumbed to corruption/transformation. Every memory-forger before her lost themselves to the power. The mentor may be the only one who found another way -- and even they carry scars.

### Growing Power, Growing Cost
As she uses the gift more, the physical changes accelerate. What was once hidden becomes harder to conceal.

---

## Movement III: Burning (Chapters 7-8)

### The Line Crossed
**What She Does:** Uses someone's memories without consent to gain information or power.

This is the hardening moment. She has done what the cult does -- taken memories without permission. The justification was survival, but the act was the same.

### The Transformation Accelerates
The physical changes are now unmistakable. She sees the cult in her own reflection. The friend who turns away from her is not wrong about what they see.

### The Choice Approaches
She stands at a crossroads. The power offers more -- always more. The transformation whispers that humanity is weakness, that the old ways of the cult are simply the natural end of the path.

---

## Movement IV: Forging (Chapters 9-10)

### The Path to Mastery
**What Mastery Requires:** Accepting a painful truth about herself or her power.

The mentor's final lesson, delivered before their death: the truth she has been avoiding. What the power really is. Where it comes from. What she must accept to wield it without being consumed.

### The Mastery Moment
**How She Achieves It:** A near-death experience forces her through the transformation and out the other side.

At the darkest moment, when she is closest to becoming the enemy, the transformation completes -- but not as destruction. She passes through the fire and emerges changed but still herself.

### The Surrender
At the Apex, she does not use the mastered power to destroy the cult leader. She surrenders it entirely. The gift goes away, breaking the cycle forever.
