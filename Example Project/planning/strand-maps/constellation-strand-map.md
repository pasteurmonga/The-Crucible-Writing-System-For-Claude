# Constellation Strand Map: The Memory Forge

## The Core Bond

**The Anchor:** Sworn friendship -- a childhood friend who chose to follow her into danger.

This is the relationship that saves her when she is closest to becoming the enemy. The friend is fierce and protective, willing to fight for her even when she cannot fight for herself.

## Movement I: The Intimate Constellation (Chapters 1-3)

### Starting Constellation
- The protagonist (restless blacksmith)
- The childhood friend (already close, protective)
- Village community (lost at Ignition)

### Ignition Impact
The attack scatters everything. The friend survives -- possibly because they were with her, possibly through luck. The rest of the village is destroyed or scattered.

### New Connections
- The memory-keepers (burden becomes relationship)
- The mentor (discovered with the keepers, or sought out after)

---

## Movement II: Testing Bonds (Chapters 4-6)

### The Friend's Struggle
As her power grows and changes her, the friend must grapple with their own inadequacy. They cannot share her burden, cannot understand her transformation. They can only watch and worry.

### The Mentor's Teaching
The mentor guides her, but also challenges her. Their lessons are not comfortable. They speak of all who came before, all who failed.

### Strain Beginning
The friendship begins to show cracks. Small moments of distance. The friend sees changes they cannot name.

---

## Movement III: Breaking and Expanding (Chapters 7-8)

### The Friendship Strains to Breaking
**What Causes It:** Her ruthless choices, the line she crossed (using memories without consent), what she has become.

The friend turns away from her after seeing what she's become. This is not abandonment but horror -- horror at what she did, what she's becoming.

### New Allies
**Who Joins:** Political figures with their own agendas -- specifically a noble who opposes the cult for their own reasons.

The constellation expands even as its core fractures. These new allies bring resources but also complications.

### The Protagonist Alone
At the end of Movement III, she is more powerful than ever but more isolated. The friend is gone. The mentor will soon die. She is surrounded by people but truly alone.

---

## Movement IV: Reconciliation and Loss (Chapters 9-10)

### The Mentor's Death
**How:** The mentor sacrifices themselves to save her from the cult leader.

This sacrifice models the surrender she must eventually make. The mentor shows her that giving up everything can be the ultimate victory.

### The Friend Returns
**Why:** When she is at her darkest, closest to becoming the enemy, the childhood friendship saves her.

The friend's return is not because she has proven worthy again, but because the friend chooses to return despite everything. This is the true test of the bond -- love that persists through transformation.

### The Final Constellation
At the Apex, she is surrounded by:
- The returned friend
- The political ally (and their forces)
- The mercy recipients (now unexpected agents)
- The surviving keepers

### After the Apex
**Fate of the Constellation:** Dispersed to rebuild -- each person goes their own way with purpose, carrying something important.

The constellation scatters like the keepers themselves. But unlike at Ignition, this scattering is purposeful. Each carries something forward.
