# Forge Point 0: Ignition

## The Moment Everything Changes

**Chapter:** 2

**Purpose:** Ignition is the event that destroys the protagonist's ordinary world and makes return impossible. It is not a choice but a catastrophe that forces her onto the path.

---

## The Crisis

**What Destroys Her Ordinary World:** The cult attacks her village, destroying everything she knows.

The attack comes without warning. The cult has found something in this village -- perhaps they sensed her latent power, perhaps they sought the memory-keepers hiding nearby, perhaps both. Whatever the reason, they come with fire and memory-weapons, and nothing survives unchanged.

### What She Loses
- Her home (the forge where she worked)
- Her community (the villagers she knew)
- Her identity as a simple blacksmith
- Her belief that the world makes sense

### What She Witnesses
- The cult's memory-weapons in action
- People losing themselves, forgetting who they are
- The horror of stolen memories
- Her own power erupting in response

---

## Point of No Return

**What Makes Return Impossible:** Her power was revealed during the attack -- she is now marked.

In the chaos, her latent gift explodes outward. She forges something -- a weapon, a shield, something made of stolen memory -- and it saves her life. But the cult sees. She is now known to them. She cannot go back to being a simple blacksmith because she is no longer a simple blacksmith.

### The Marking
- The cult knows what she is
- Her power has manifested visibly
- The first physical changes have begun
- She has killed (or damaged) with her gift

---

## The Fire Ignites

**How Her Power First Manifests:** Crisis explosion -- erupts unbidden during the village attack, terrifying and uncontrolled.

She does not choose to use the power. It uses her. In a moment of absolute terror, when death seems certain, something inside her reaches out and takes. A memory. A piece of someone. And forges it into something terrible.

### The First Forging
- Uncontrolled and instinctive
- She doesn't understand what she did
- It saved her but horrified her
- It marked her as one of them (like the cult)

---

## What Survives

### People
- The childhood friend (survives with her or finds her after)
- Perhaps a handful of villagers (scattered)

### Things
- Her blacksmith's tools (symbolic)
- The memory-weapon she accidentally created
- Knowledge that the old ways are real

### Questions
- What happened to her?
- Who were those attackers?
- What does this power mean?

---

## Transition to Chapter 3

After Ignition, she flees. The cult pursues (or will pursue). She needs to understand what happened to her. She needs somewhere safe.

This flight will lead her to the memory-keepers and the mentor, connecting her to her burden and her guide.
