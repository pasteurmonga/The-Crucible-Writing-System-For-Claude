# Constellation Bible: The Memory Forge

## The Protagonist

### Identity
**Name:** Kira
**Role:** Young blacksmith, memory-forger, guardian

### Before Ignition (Unlit State)
**Who She Is:** Restless but trapped -- she feels something is missing, but village life holds her.

She is good at her work but not passionate about it. She has dreams she cannot name. She feels like she was meant for something more but cannot imagine what that might be.

### The Wound
**What Haunts Her:** Lost someone close -- parent, sibling, or friend.

Before the story begins, she suffered a loss that shaped her. This loss:
- Made her believe she was not worthy of good things
- Taught her that loving means losing
- Left her guarded, reluctant to connect deeply
- May connect to the village attack (the cult took memories even before)

### The Lie She Believes
**The False Truth:** "I am not worthy of good things."

She believes that good things are taken from her. That loving someone means they will be lost. That she somehow causes the suffering of those around her.

### Arc Summary
| Movement | State | Change |
|----------|-------|--------|
| I | Restless blacksmith | Becomes marked wielder |
| II | Learning, hopeful | Grows in power and connection |
| III | Hardened, crossing lines | Becomes what she feared |
| IV | Surrendered, transformed | Becomes guardian without power |

## The Faithful (Childhood Friend)

### Identity
**Name:** Tam
**Role:** The anchor, the one who won't abandon her

### Character Type
**Who They Are:** Fierce protector -- willing to fight for her.

This friend has always been her defender. They are:
- Loyal to a fault
- Physical in their love (actions over words)
- Brave in ordinary ways (no magic, just courage)
- Stubborn about the people they care for

### Their Own Struggle
**What They Fear:** Fear of inadequacy -- they cannot do what she does.

As she grows in power, the friend feels increasingly useless:
- They cannot fight memory-forgers
- They cannot help with the transformation
- They can only watch and worry
- Their ordinary courage seems meaningless

### Arc Summary
| Movement | State | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| I | Protective, present | Survives the attack with her |
| II | Supportive, worried | Watches her change, fears for her |
| III | Breaking point | Turns away after seeing her cross the line |
| IV | Returning, saving | Comes back, anchors her in darkest moment |

### Key Moments
- **Chapter 2:** Present during Ignition, first to see her power
- **Chapter 6:** Visible strain, first arguments
- **Chapter 8:** The departure -- sees her use memories without consent
- **Chapter 9/10:** The return -- arrives when she's about to fall

---

## The Mentor

### Identity
**Name:** Elder Varos
**Role:** Wise elder, guide, model of surrender

### Character Type
**Who They Are:** Ancient keeper of knowledge and memory.

The mentor is:
- Old (perhaps impossibly old)
- Calm in crisis
- Carrying their own history with the power
- Perhaps a former wielder who found another way

### The Crucial Lesson
**What They Teach:** That surrender is strength, not weakness.

Throughout the story, they teach many things:
- The history of memory-forging
- The fate of previous wielders
- Techniques to control (or at least survive) the power
- But the final lesson is that the power cannot be mastered through strength

### Their Sacrifice
**How They Die:** Sacrifices themselves to save her from the cult leader.

In death, they demonstrate the lesson:
- They give up everything to protect her
- The sacrifice is an action, not words
- It models what she must eventually do
- It breaks through her despair

### Arc Summary
| Movement | State | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| I | Introduction | Met among keepers, begins teaching |
| II | Teaching | Guides her power, warns of danger |
| III | Warning | Sees her hardening, speaks truth |
| IV | Sacrifice | Dies to save her, final lesson |

## The Political Ally

### Identity
**Name:** Lady Celene Mirren
**Role:** Noble with agenda, brings resources

### Character Type
**Who They Are:** A noble who opposes the cult for their own reasons.

This ally is:
- Politically powerful (leads coalition of noble houses and merchant guilds)
- Morally ambiguous (sees Kira as a weapon, not a person)
- Useful but not trustworthy
- Fighting the cult for reasons that may not align with hers
- Steel-gray hair, perhaps fifty, sharp eyes that miss nothing
- Practical traveling clothes of fine quality

### Their Agenda
They oppose the cult because:
- The cult threatens their power base
- They have personal grievances
- Political survival requires it
- They see opportunity in the conflict

### Role in Story
- **Joins:** Movement III (Chapter 7) -- meets Kira after the escape from siege
- **Provides:** Military forces, political cover, resources, farmstead refuge
- **Complicates:** Their agenda may conflict with protecting keepers
- **At Apex:** Their forces provide military support

---

## The Political Rival

### Identity
**Name:** Lord Harren
**Role:** Ambitious minor noble, traitor

### Character Type
**Who They Are:** A young lord (about thirty) whose lands border cult territory.

This rival is:
- Self-serving to a fault
- Soft hands, hard eyes -- cruelty learned early
- Views keepers as liability, Kira as a weapon to be controlled
- Willing to betray the alliance to save himself

### What Happened
- Chapter 7: Attempted to betray keepers to Sethren
- Exposed by Kira catching his spy network
- MERCY 3: Exiled instead of executed
- Stripped of lands and titles

### Payoff Expected
- Chapter 10: Returns with military forces (either allied or hostile, depending on arc)

---

## Sethren's Ally (Mercy 4 Recipient)

### Identity
**Name:** Captain Theron
**Role:** Sethren's trusted lieutenant, personal guard captain

### Character Type
**Who They Are:** A twenty-year veteran of Sethren's forces.

This character is:
- Loyal to Sethren from genuine belief, not coercion
- Sees Sethren's plan as salvation, not destruction
- Witnessed Sethren's sister die, understands his motivation
- Resigned to fate when captured, not defiant

### Key Moment
- Chapter 8: Spared by Kira after convoy raid
- Told to return to Sethren with a message
- Confused by mercy, but complies

### Payoff Expected
- Chapter 10: Becomes "Unexpected Agent" at Apex
- His confusion about Kira's mercy leads to wavering loyalty

---

## The Memory-Keepers

### Role
Living burden -- the people she must protect.

### Composition
A small group (perhaps 10-20) of people who:
- Carry the old memories
- Are the last repositories of the old ways
- Include knowledge the cult fears
- Range in age (some ancient, some young)

### Key Individual Keepers
[To be developed during outlining]
- The elder leader (perhaps distinct from the mentor)
- A young keeper she bonds with
- One who doubts her

### Arc
- **Movement I:** Discovered, some die at First Forge Point
- **Movement II:** Growing trust, deeper connection
- **Movement III:** Endangered by her choices
- **Movement IV:** Scattered to safety at resolution
