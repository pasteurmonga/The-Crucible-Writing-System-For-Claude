# Planning Phase Context

This CLAUDE.md loads when you access the planning/ directory.

## Planning Documents

When working in the planning phase, the following documents are available:

### Core Structure
- `crucible-thesis.md` - The central question and answer of the story
- `strand-maps/quest-strand.md` - Quest strand (12 beats)
- `strand-maps/fire-strand.md` - Fire strand (12 beats)
- `strand-maps/constellation-strand.md` - Constellation strand (12 beats)

### Forge Points
- `forge-points/` - The 5 major turning points where strands weave together

### Character & World

- `constellation-bible.md` - Character profiles and relationships
- `mercy-ledger.md` - Mercy engine tracking
- `world-forge.md` - World-building and magic systems

## How to Load

Do NOT load all documents at once. Load strategically:

1. **For thesis work**: Read only `crucible-thesis.md`
2. **For strand mapping**: Read one strand at a time
3. **For character work**: Read `constellation-bible.md`
4. **For world-building**: Read `world-forge.md`

## Planning Rules

- Complete each planning document before moving to the next
- Save answers to planning-state.json after each document
- Do not skip to outlining until all 7 documents are complete
