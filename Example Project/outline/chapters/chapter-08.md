### Scene 3: The True Plan Revealed
**Setting:** War council
**Characters:** Kira, keepers, Political Ally
**Purpose:** Full revelation of cult's plan

**What Happens:**
- New intelligence confirms the worst
- The cult is building a great forge -- a device to reshape all memory
- When complete, it will erase collective memory entirely
- The world will forget everything: history, identity, love
- Timeline: they have weeks, maybe days

**Emotional Beat:** Horror, urgency

**Stakes Crystal Clear:**
- If Sethren completes the forge, everyone loses themselves
- The keepers must be protected -- they're the last repositories
- But protection isn't enough; the forge must be destroyed

---

### Scene 4: Preparation for Battle
**Setting:** Camp
**Characters:** All
**Purpose:** Show Kira's growing power and isolation

**What Happens:**
- Kira prepares for a strike against a cult position

- Others look at her with awe and fear
- She is becoming a weapon, not a person
- Even those she protects are afraid of her

**Emotional Beat:** Power at the cost of humanity

**Transformation Marker:**
- Undeniably inhuman characteristics now

- Memory ghosts surround her constantly
- She has to concentrate to appear normal

**What Happens:**
- During an operation, Kira encounters someone close to Sethren
- Not a foot soldier, but someone important to him

- But she sees something in them: fear, humanity

**Emotional Beat:** Moral choice in combat

---

### Scene 6: Mercy 4 -- The Cult Leader's Ally
**Setting:** Same
**Characters:** Kira, Sethren's ally
**Purpose:** MERCY 4 -- Fourth act of compassion

**What Happens:**
- Kira chooses mercy, sparing them
- This is the costliest mercy -- she puts herself in danger
- She may sustain injury or allow escape
- The ally looks at her with confusion
- "Why?"

**MERCY 4: Sethren's Ally**
- Recipient: Someone close to the cult leader
- Cost: Personal risk, possible strategic setback
- Payoff (Chapter 10): They become the "Unexpected Agent" at Apex

**Emotional Beat:** Clinging to identity despite transformation

**Key Dialogue:**
- Ally: "You could have killed me. Why didn't you?"
- Kira: "Because I'm not you. Not yet."
- Ally: "You will be. Everyone like you ends up like him."
- Kira: "Maybe. But not today."

### Scene 7: The Breaking Point

**What Happens:**
- Tam saw the battle, saw what Kira has become

- The crossing, the transformation, the loss of who she was
- This is not a fight -- it's a farewell

**FORGE POINT 2: The Betrayal**
- Tam turns away from Kira
- Not to join the enemy, but to stop enabling her
- They leave, walk away, refuse to watch anymore

**Emotional Beat:** Heartbreak, abandonment

**Key Dialogue:**
- Tam: "I've watched you become everything you swore to destroy."
- Kira: "I'm protecting people!"
- Tam: "You're becoming a monster to fight monsters. And I can't watch anymore."
- Kira: "Tam, please--"
- Tam: "I love you. That's why I'm leaving. Because the Kira I knew would want someone to stop her."
- [Tam leaves]

- The Political Ally uses her
- Varos worries about her
- She is more powerful than ever, and utterly alone

**Emotional Beat:** Desolation, temptation to give in

**Key Internal Moment:**

---

### Scene 9: The Whisper of Surrender

**Characters:** Kira (and maybe Varos at a distance)
**Purpose:** Plant the seed for the answer

- "Perhaps you let it burn through you and out the other side"
