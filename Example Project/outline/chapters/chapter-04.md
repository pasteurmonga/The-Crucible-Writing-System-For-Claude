## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Road of Memory
**Setting:** Wilderness, traveling
**Characters:** Kira, Tam, Elder Varos, keepers
**Purpose:** Show the group on the move, deepen relationships

**What Happens:**
- The group travels to a safer location (another sanctuary or hidden place)
- Elder Varos uses the journey to teach Kira about her gift
- The keepers tell stories, preserving memories even while fleeing

### Scene 2: The First Lesson
**Setting:** Camp during rest
**Characters:** Kira, Elder Varos
**Purpose:** Begin understanding memory-forging

**What Happens:**
- Varos begins formal teaching
- Memory-forging explained:
  - It takes memories from others (the taking)
  - It shapes them into power or objects (the forging)
  - Every use changes the wielder (the cost)
- Kira learns what happened to previous wielders: all succumbed
- Varos hints there might be another way

**Emotional Beat:** Wonder mixed with dread

**Key Dialogue:**
- Varos: "Memory is the substance of identity. When you forge it, you're working with the essence of who people are."
- Kira: "And every time I use it, I become less... me?"
- Varos: "Less human, at least. But perhaps that's not the only path."

### Scene 3: Tam's Frustration
**Setting:** Camp, private moment
**Characters:** Kira, Tam
**Purpose:** Show Tam's struggle with inadequacy

- Tam expresses frustration: feels useless, unable to help
- Kira reassures them, but the gap is real
- First small crack in their friendship

**Emotional Beat:** Love strained by inequality

**Key Dialogue:**
- Tam: "I've always protected you. Now you could destroy me with a thought."
