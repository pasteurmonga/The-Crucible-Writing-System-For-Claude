**Characters:** Kira (alone initially)
**Purpose:** Establish Kira's skill and restlessness

**What Happens:**
- Kira works the forge before dawn, a habit she's developed
- She is good at her work but finds no joy in it
- Internal reflection: she feels she was meant for something more
- Physical action: forging a simple tool, but she pauses, distracted by something she can't name

**Emotional Beat:** Restlessness, unnamed longing

**Plants/Foreshadowing:**
- [ ] PLANT: Her hands sometimes move in patterns she doesn't consciously choose (power dormant)
- [ ] PLANT: The forge fire behaves oddly around her (subtle sign)

### Scene 2: Morning in the Village
**Setting:** The village of Thornhaven, morning market
**Characters:** Kira, Tam, villagers
**Purpose:** Establish the intimate constellation and Tam's protective nature

**What Happens:**
- Kira delivers finished work to the market
- Tam finds her, teasing about her early rising
- We see their easy friendship, Tam's fierce protectiveness
- Villagers greet them warmly -- this is a community that knows them
- A moment of tension: someone mentions "the old stories" or "those who came before"

**Emotional Beat:** Warmth of belonging, but also Kira's sense of not quite fitting

**Plants/Foreshadowing:**
- [ ] PLANT: An elder speaks of "memory-keepers" as superstition (burden foreshadowed)

- We learn about the loss: a parent, sibling, or close friend who died
- This loss taught her that loving means losing
- She believes she is not worthy of good things
- Tam may arrive and offer comfort, which Kira deflects

**Emotional Beat:** Grief held tightly, fear of connection

**Plants/Foreshadowing:**
- [ ] PLANT: The death may have mysterious elements (connected to the cult?)
- [ ] PLANT: "I couldn't save them" -- foreshadows her inability to save everyone at First Forge Point

**Setting:** The forge, evening
**Characters:** Kira, possibly Tam
**Purpose:** Show the ordinary world one last time before it ends

- A moment of peace, of almost-belonging
- Tam may stay to keep her company
- They talk about small things: village gossip, future plans
- Kira admits to dreams she can't explain, places she's never seen

**Emotional Beat:** Bittersweet contentment, the calm before the storm

**Plants/Foreshadowing:**
- [ ] PLANT: Kira dreams of places that don't exist (or do they?)
- [ ] PLANT: Strange sounds or lights in the distance (cult activity?)

---

### Scene 5: Signs of Storm
**Setting:** Village edge, night
**Characters:** Kira, travelers or strangers
**Purpose:** First tangible hint that something is wrong

**What Happens:**

**Emotional Beat:** Unease, foreshadowing of the attack

**Plants/Foreshadowing:**

- [ ] PLANT: One refugee stares at Kira strangely, as if seeing something
- [ ] PLANT: "They're looking for something. Or someone."

- Elder on old stories: "Memory-keepers are a fairy tale. The old ways died long ago."
- Refugee warning: "They come at night. And afterward, the people still walk and talk, but they're empty. They've forgotten everything."
