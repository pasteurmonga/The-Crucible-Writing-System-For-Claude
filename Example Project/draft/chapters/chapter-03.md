# Chapter 3: The Keepers of Old Ways

## Scene 1: Lost in the Wilds

They ran until the sun climbed high and Kira's legs gave out.

She collapsed against a fallen tree, chest heaving, hands pressed into the moss. The forest around them was thick and old, the kind of place where the trees grew so close together that the sky became a distant rumor. They'd been moving for hours -- she'd lost track of how many -- putting distance between themselves and the smoking ruin of Thornhaven.

But the distance didn't help. Every blink brought it back -- empty robes collapsing. The terrible pull of stolen memories flowing through her hands. The cult leader's voice: *The heir has awakened.*

"Kira." Tam crouched beside her, face streaked with soot and exhaustion. "We need to keep moving."

"I know." But she didn't get up. Her hands were trembling again, and when she looked at them, she couldn't pretend anymore. The skin was different. Harder. A faint metallic sheen caught the light filtering through the leaves.

She was becoming something else.

"What happened back there--" Tam started.

"I don't want to talk about it."

"You killed them. You reached inside them and *took* something, and they--"

"I said I don't want to talk about it."

Silence. The forest breathed around them, indifferent to their crisis. Somewhere, a bird sang. The normalcy of it felt obscene.

"We need a plan," Tam said finally. "We can't just run forever."

"Can't we?" Kira laughed, and it came out wrong. Too sharp, too brittle. "I don't know what I am, Tam. I don't know what I did. The only thing I know is that they're looking for me, and everyone around me dies."

"I'm not dead."

"Yet."

Tam's hand found her shoulder. Squeezed. "Then let's keep it that way. There has to be someone who understands what's happening to you. The refugees talked about memory-keepers. Old stories. Maybe there's truth in them."

"And if there isn't?"

"Then we figure it out ourselves." Tam stood, offering her hand. "But first, we need to move. If they tracked us this far, they'll keep coming."

Kira took the offered hand and pulled herself up. Her body ached in ways she'd never experienced -- not just physical exhaustion, but something deeper. A hollowness where the stolen memories had passed through her, leaving traces she couldn't identify.

She wondered if this was how it started. The transformation the cult leader had implied. The becoming.

Delia's face flashed through her mind -- the miller's daughter, running into the smoke after seeing what Kira had become. She didn't know if the girl had escaped. Didn't know if anyone from Thornhaven had survived except her and Tam. Another weight to carry.

"North," she said suddenly.

"What?"

"We should go north." She'd said the same thing fleeing Thornhaven, but this was different. Not reasoning -- certainty. Something calling to her. "There's something... a pull. Stronger now."

Tam's expression shifted to concern. "The cult came from the north."

"I know. But this is different." Kira pressed a hand to her chest, where the fire still burned, banked but present. "It's like... like something is calling me. Something old."

"And you want to follow a mysterious voice in your head? After everything that just happened?"

"Do you have a better idea?"

Tam didn't. They both knew it.

"Fine," Tam said. "North it is. But if we run into cultists, we run. No heroics. No standing your ground."

"Agreed."

It was a lie, and they both knew that too. But it was easier than the truth.

They walked.

## Scene 2: Discovery of the Hidden Place

The pull grew stronger as they traveled.

It wasn't a voice -- nothing so clear as that. More like a pressure behind Kira's eyes, a warmth in her chest that intensified when she turned in the right direction and faded when she strayed. She followed it the way a compass needle follows north, not understanding why, only knowing that she must.

Tam stayed close, knife in hand, eyes scanning the shadows. "How much further?"

"I don't know." Kira pushed through a tangle of brush, thorns catching at her clothes. "It's close. I think."

"You think."

"I've never done this before."

The forest had changed around them. The trees here were older, their trunks twisted in ways that suggested centuries of growth. Moss hung from branches like curtains, and the air tasted different -- thicker, somehow. Charged with something she couldn't name.

And the memories...

Kira stopped, swaying. They pressed against her now. Not specific thoughts or images, but a presence. Layers of experience pressed into the very soil, the stones, the bark of the ancient trees. This place remembered. Remembered *everything*.

"What is it?" Tam moved to her side. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong." Kira's voice came out hushed. "This place is... it's saturated. Memories everywhere. I can almost see them."

"That's not comforting."

They pressed on, and the trees opened without warning onto a clearing that shouldn't have existed. One moment they were pushing through dense undergrowth; the next, they stood at the edge of a hidden valley, its slopes green with cultivated gardens and dotted with structures that looked grown rather than built.

A settlement. Hidden in the heart of the wilderness, invisible from any angle until you stood right on top of it.

"How is this possible?" Tam whispered. "We should have seen--"

"Protection." Kira understood it now, the way she'd understood the word *memory-forged* without being told. "The memories here are shaped to conceal. Anyone looking would simply... look past."

"And you could find it anyway."

"Because I'm..." She didn't finish. Didn't want to.

Movement below. Figures emerging from the strange buildings, gathering in the valley's center. They'd been spotted.

"Weapons," Tam said, tensing.

"Wait." Kira held up a hand. The figures weren't attacking. They were watching. Waiting. As if they'd been expecting this moment for a very long time.

She started down the slope.

"Kira--"

"They won't hurt us." She didn't know how she knew. But the pull in her chest had resolved into something warm, almost welcoming. Whatever these people were, they were the source of the call.

The memory-keepers.

They had to be.

---

## Scene 3: Meeting Elder Varos

The keepers gathered at the valley's edge to meet them.

They were a motley group -- old and young, dressed in simple homespun, their faces marked by the kind of wariness that came from generations of hiding. Kira counted perhaps twenty, though more might have stayed in the buildings. A family here, a lone elder there, two children clutching each other's hands.

But they all had one thing in common: they stared at Kira like she was a ghost.

A woman stepped forward, gray-streaked hair pulled back in a severe braid. "How did you find us?"

"I followed..." Kira hesitated. "I felt something. A pull."

The woman's eyes narrowed. "No one has found the Sanctuary in decades. The protection--"

"Let her pass, Mira." The voice was old, creaking like ancient wood, but it carried across the gathering with effortless authority. The crowd parted, and a figure emerged from behind them.

Elder Varos.

Kira knew the name without being told, the same way she'd known so many things since the Ignition. The elder was impossibly old -- skin like parchment, hands gnarled as tree roots, eyes that had seen centuries come and go. They walked with a staff, each step deliberate, but there was nothing frail about them. Power lived in those bones. Ancient, patient, watchful.

Varos stopped an arm's length from Kira and studied her face.

"You carry the gift." Not a question. "I haven't seen it manifest in... a very long time."

"I don't want it." The words spilled out before Kira could stop them. "I don't understand it. I killed people. I took something from them and they just... they were *gone*."

"Yes." No judgment in Varos's voice. Only understanding. "That is what the forge-touched do. We take. We shape. We transform." A pause. "And if we are not careful, we become something no longer human."

The gathered keepers murmured. The woman called Mira stepped forward again. "Elder, if she's what you say--"

"She is what she is." Varos raised a hand, silencing her. "And she has come to us. That is not coincidence. The gift does not emerge without need." Those ancient eyes returned to Kira. "What happened to your village?"

"The cult." Tam spoke up, moving to stand beside Kira. "They came at night. Memory-weapons. They emptied people -- took everything, left shells. They were looking for something."

"For someone," Varos corrected gently. "They were looking for her."

"Why?" Kira demanded. "What am I to them?"

"A threat. A hope. A weapon, if they can turn you." Varos gestured toward the settlement. "Come. You are exhausted, and there is much to explain. But know this, child: you are not alone in what you are. Others have walked this path before you."

"What happened to them?"

Varos's expression flickered -- grief, quickly hidden. "That is part of what we must discuss."

They followed the elder into the hidden valley, the keepers parting around them like water around stone. Some stared with fear. Others with hope. A few with something that looked terribly like worship.

Kira didn't know which was worse.

---

## Scene 4: The Keepers' Story

The sanctuary's main building was larger than it appeared from outside, its walls carved from living wood that still held the memory of being trees. Inside, the air thrummed with a presence Kira was beginning to recognize -- concentrated history, layered so thick it was almost visible.

Elder Varos led them to a chamber at the structure's heart, where a fire burned in a pit that seemed to have been there since the world was young. The flames cast dancing shadows on walls covered in symbols Kira couldn't read but somehow understood.

"Sit." Varos settled onto a cushion by the fire, movements slow but deliberate. "What I tell you now, I have told to no one in many years. The last person who needed to hear it died before you were born."

Kira sat. Tam remained standing, positioned between Kira and the door. Protective to the last.

"The memory-keepers are exactly what our name suggests." Varos's voice took on the rhythm of old telling. "We are the repositories of the old world. Before the Forgetting -- before the cult rose and began their campaign of erasure -- we were scholars, historians, librarians of the living past. Each of us carries memories that are not our own. Generations of knowledge, preserved in mind rather than stone."

"Why?" Tam asked. "Why not write it down?"

"Because what is written can be burned. What is carved can be defaced. But what lives in memory..." Varos tapped their temple. "That can only be taken by force. And taking memories leaves traces. Costs. The cult discovered this too late. Every mind they emptied, every life they erased, it all went somewhere. It became something."

"The weapons," Kira breathed. "The memory-forged weapons."

"Yes. The cult weaponized what they stole. But they cannot create -- only take. They need the memories of others to fuel their power. That is why they hunt the keepers. We hold the largest concentration of preserved knowledge in the world. If they could take it..."

"They'd be unstoppable."

Varos nodded. "And there is something else. Something they fear even more than our knowledge." Those ancient eyes fixed on Kira. "The memories we carry include knowledge of how to stop them. How to unmake what they have built. And most dangerous of all -- knowledge of the forge-touched. What they are. What they can become."

"What *can* they become?"

"That depends on the wielder." Varos leaned forward, firelight dancing across their weathered features. "Every forge-touched before you followed the same path. The power offers strength, and strength is seductive. You take more. Forge more. With each use, the transformation advances. You become less flesh, more... something else. Eventually, you become the power itself. A being of pure memory-force, no longer human in any meaningful sense."

Kira's hands clenched. "And if I don't want that?"

"Then you must find another way. Previous wielders could not -- or would not. They succumbed, one after another. Some joined the cult willingly, seduced by promises of controlled ascension. Others fought until the power consumed them." A pause. "But there are whispers. Old texts. Suggestions that there might be a way to master the gift without being destroyed by it. Or..."

"Or?"

"Or a way to end it forever. To surrender the power at its peak and close the door on memory-forging entirely." Varos's voice softened. "But that knowledge, if it ever existed, is fragmentary. We have only pieces. And the cult has been hunting those pieces for generations."

The fire crackled. Shadows danced. Kira felt the weight of centuries pressing down on her, the accumulated burden of everyone who had walked this path and failed.

"Why me?" she asked finally. "Why now?"

"That, child, I cannot answer. The gift manifests where it will. But I believe..." Varos hesitated. "I believe you were meant to find us. That whatever comes next, you are meant to face it. Whether you succeed where others failed..."

The elder's eyes held something that might have been hope. Or might have been fear.

"That remains to be seen."

---

## Scene 5: The Calm Before

They gave Kira a room -- small, simple, with a window overlooking the hidden valley. She sat on the narrow bed and stared at her hands.

The changes were more visible now. The metallic sheen had spread from her fingertips to her palms, and when she pressed the skin, it felt like touching thin metal over flesh. Her eyes, reflected in a basin of water, held a faint silver gleam that hadn't been there this morning.

*The transformation advances.*

She was becoming something else. Something not human. And every time she used the power, it would get worse.

A knock at the door. Tam entered without waiting for a response.

"Varos wants to start your training tomorrow." Tam leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "They seem to think you can learn to control it."

"And what do you think?"

"I think you killed three men by accident. Sucked the memories right out of them like pulling water from a well." Tam's voice was carefully neutral. "I think if you can't control it, you'll do it again. Maybe to someone who doesn't deserve it."

"Maybe to you."

"Maybe."

Kira's throat tightened. She looked away. "You should leave. Find somewhere safe. The cult is hunting me, not you."

"Don't be stupid."

"I'm serious, Tam. Everyone around me--"

"Dies. Yes, you said." Tam crossed the room and sat beside her on the bed. Their shoulders touched. "Here's the thing: I watched you save that little girl. Delia. You threw yourself between her and those monsters when you could have run. That's not someone who gets people killed. That's someone who gets herself killed trying to protect them."

"I'm not--"

"You are. You've always been." Tam's hand found hers, grip firm despite the strange texture of Kira's skin. "When we were kids and old Merrick's barn caught fire, you ran inside to save the horses while the rest of us just stood there. You were eight. Eight years old, Kira. You've been throwing yourself in front of danger for as long as I've known you."

"That doesn't mean--"

"It means I'm not leaving. It means we face this together, like we've faced everything else." Tam squeezed her hand. "Besides, someone has to make sure you eat. You're useless at taking care of yourself."

A small sound escaped Kira -- half laugh, half sob. "You're impossible."

"I learned from the best."

They sat in silence for a while, watching the afternoon light shift across the valley. For a few moments, Kira could almost pretend things were normal. That she was just a blacksmith from a small village, that Thornhaven still stood, that the fire inside her was nothing but a dream.

But the fire burned on.

A child appeared in the doorway. Perhaps seven or eight, with dark hair and enormous eyes that held no fear, only curiosity. Kira recognized the look -- the same fascination Delia had shown when watching her work the forge.

"Are you the one who makes things?" the girl asked. "From memories?"

Kira glanced at Tam, then back at the child. "I... yes. I suppose I am."

"Elder Varos says you're going to save us." The girl stepped into the room, approaching with the directness of the very young. "Are you?"

"I don't know."

"I hope so." The girl reached out and touched Kira's metallic hand. Her small fingers traced the strange texture without flinching. "My mother says the cult took my father. Took his memories, so now he doesn't know who I am. Can you give them back?"

Kira's throat tightened. "I don't... I don't know if I can do that."

"But you can try?"

The hope in those eyes was unbearable. Kira thought of Thornhaven, of the villagers left as empty shells. Of everything she'd failed to save.

"I can try," she said. "I promise I'll try."

The girl smiled, bright and trusting. Then she turned and scampered out of the room, leaving Kira with a weight she hadn't expected to carry.

"You shouldn't have said that," Tam murmured.

"I know." Kira looked down at her hands -- tools of destruction, maybe. Or tools of something else. "But I'm going to try anyway."

---

## Scene 6: The Cult Finds Them

The attack came at dusk.

Kira was in the main hall, listening to Varos explain the basics of control, when the first shout echoed across the valley. She was on her feet before the sound finished, the fire inside her flaring in response.

"They found us." Mira burst through the door, face white. "Scouts on the eastern ridge. A dozen at least."

"How?" Varos rose slowly, but their voice was steady. "The protections--"

"She led them here." Mira pointed at Kira, and the accusation in her eyes was sharp as any blade. "They followed her trail."

Kira's stomach dropped. "I didn't mean--"

"It doesn't matter what you meant." Varos raised a hand to silence them both. "What matters is what we do now. How much time?"

"Minutes. Maybe less. They're moving fast."

The elder turned to the gathered keepers -- perhaps fifteen had been in the hall, receiving what they'd called "memory lessons." Their faces held varying degrees of terror. These were scholars and refugees, not fighters. If the cult reached them...

"The hidden path," Varos said. "The one through the caverns. Take as many as you can. I'll buy time."

"You can't fight them," Mira protested.

"No. But she can." Varos's eyes found Kira. "If she chooses to."

The choice crystallized in an instant. Run, and some of the keepers might escape -- but the cult would keep coming, keep hunting. Fight, and maybe she could stop them here. But she might fail. Might not be strong enough. Might watch more people die because she couldn't save them.

*I couldn't save them.*

The old wound. The old fear. Everyone she loved, taken by forces she couldn't fight.

But these weren't forces. They were men with stolen weapons. And she had something they didn't.

She had a forge.

"Get everyone to safety," Kira said. "As many as you can. I'll hold them off."

"Kira--" Tam started.

"No arguments. Get them out."

"I'm staying." Tam's hand went to her knife. "Don't ask me to run. I won't."

There wasn't time to argue. Already, the sounds of fighting had begun -- cult members clashing with the few keepers who had any combat training. Screams echoed across the valley.

Kira ran toward them.

---

## Scene 7: The First Forge Point

The cult had brought more than a dozen. They poured into the sanctuary from three directions, memory-weapons blazing with stolen light, cutting down anyone in their path.

They fell. Each keeper who lost themselves became a ripple in the fabric of the world, a candle snuffed out. The loss echoed in her bones, in her blood, in the fire that roared to life inside her chest.

*No more.*

She met the first wave at the valley's center.

The cult fighters saw her and hesitated -- they'd been told about her, warned about what she could do. But hesitation wasn't enough. Kira reached out with strange new senses and *pulled*.

The nearest weapon shattered. Its trapped memories scattered like startled birds, and she caught them, gathered them, shaped them into something new. A shield of pure light materialized in her left hand as a blade formed in her right. Not the wild, uncontrolled forging of Thornhaven -- this was intentional. Still rough, still dangerous, but hers.

"The heir," someone hissed. "Take her alive--"

She didn't give them the chance.

Kira threw herself into the cult's formation, and the world became chaos. She fought the way she'd worked the forge -- rhythm and heat, hammer and fire, shaping the moment to her will. Weapons rose to meet hers and shattered. Cultists fell back or fell entirely.

But there were too many.

"Kira!" Tam's voice, from somewhere to her left. "Behind you!"

She spun, and her shield caught a blade that would have taken her head. The impact jarred her arm, sent her stumbling. Two more cultists pressed the advantage, driving her back toward the buildings.

Through the chaos, she saw Varos directing the evacuation. Keepers streaming toward a cave entrance at the valley's far edge. Some would make it. Some.

But not all.

A scream -- high, young, terrified. Kira's head snapped toward the sound. The girl from earlier, the one who'd asked if Kira could save them, was backed against a wall. A cult member advanced on her, weapon raised.

*No.*

Kira moved without thinking. She abandoned her fight, threw herself across the battlefield, reached for the attacker with everything she had--

Too slow.

The weapon touched the girl's forehead. Kira saw the light drain from those eyes, saw the child become a shell, saw everything that made her *her* vanish into the cult's blade.

*No. No. NO.*

Something inside Kira snapped.

The fire erupted.

It wasn't controlled this time. It was rage and grief and terrible, terrible power, flooding out of her like a dam breaking. Every cult member in the valley staggered. Some fell. The one who'd taken the girl's memories screamed as Kira reached into him and *pulled*, not just his weapon but everything -- every stolen memory, every moment of his life, all of it ripped away and forged into a wave of destruction that swept the remaining cultists off their feet.

When it was over, she stood in the center of the valley, surrounded by empty robes and scattered weapons. Her skin blazed with metallic light. Her eyes burned silver.

And at her feet, the girl lay empty. Breathing. Alive in every physical sense.

But gone.

---

## Scene 8: The Weight of Failure

They found Kira kneeling beside the girl's body.

Body wasn't the right word -- she was still alive, still breathing, heart still beating. But when Kira looked into those eyes, there was nothing. No recognition. No memory. Just a hollow space where a child had been.

"I wasn't fast enough." Her voice came from somewhere distant. "I tried, and I wasn't--"

"You saved the rest of us." Tam crouched beside her, careful not to touch. "The cult retreated. The keepers who made it to the caves are safe."

"How many?"

Tam didn't answer.

"How many, Tam?"

"Eleven made it out. Including Varos."

Eleven. Out of perhaps twenty. Nine souls lost -- some to the cult's weapons, some to Kira's desperate forging. The echoes of them lived inside her now, memories that weren't hers, lives she'd accidentally consumed in the chaos of battle.

"The girl's name was Sera." Varos appeared at the edge of her vision, leaning heavily on their staff. "Her father was taken six months ago. She came to us hoping we could help her find him."

"I promised her." Kira's hands were shaking. The metallic sheen had spread to her wrists now, visible even through her sleeves. "I promised I would try."

"And you did." Varos's voice held no accusation. No comfort either -- just simple truth. "You fought. You saved those who could be saved. That is all anyone can ask."

"It's not enough."

"It never is." The elder settled onto a nearby stone, old bones creaking. "Every wielder before you learned this lesson. The power offers strength, but strength alone cannot save everyone. Cannot undo what has been done. Cannot bring back the lost."

"Then what's the point?" Kira looked up, and the anger in her voice surprised her. "What's the point of any of this if I can't save them?"

"You carry their memory now." Varos met her eyes steadily. "The keepers who fell, their knowledge lives in you. The girl's father, if you ever find what the cult took from him, you could restore it. The power is not only destruction. It is also preservation. Transformation. Choice."

"I don't want it."

"No. But you have it nonetheless."

The surviving keepers had begun to emerge from the caves, some wounded, all shaken. They looked at the destruction -- the scorched ground, the empty robes, the bodies of those who hadn't escaped -- and their eyes eventually found Kira.

She expected fear. Hatred, even. She'd brought this upon them. Led the cult to their sanctuary. Failed to protect them all.

But one by one, they approached. An old man touched her shoulder. A young woman murmured thanks. A boy her age nodded, something like respect in his gaze.

"You came back for us," someone said. "You could have run. But you stayed."

Kira shook her head. "It wasn't enough."

"It was more than anyone else would have done."

She didn't believe them. Couldn't believe them. But she accepted their words because what else could she do? The dead were dead. The emptied were empty. And she was still here, still carrying the fire, still becoming something she didn't understand.

Tam helped her to her feet. "We need to move. The cult will send more."

Kira nodded. But before she followed the others toward the caves, she knelt beside Sera one last time. The girl's eyes stared at nothing, seeing nothing, remembering nothing.

"I'm sorry," Kira whispered. "I'll find a way. Somehow. I'll find a way to bring them back."

A promise she had no idea how to keep.

But she would die trying.

---

## Scene 9: Accepting the Burden

Night found them in the caverns beyond the sanctuary.

The keepers had built a temporary camp in a chamber large enough to hold them all, its walls glittering with crystals that held their own faint memories of ancient geology. Fires burned low. Voices murmured. The trauma of the attack hung over everything like smoke.

Kira sat apart from the others, her back against cold stone. She'd tried to sleep, but every time she closed her eyes, she saw Sera's face going empty. Felt the stolen memories churning inside her, demanding to be used.

Footsteps approached. Varos settled beside her, moving with the careful slowness of the very old.

"You should rest," Kira said.

"So should you." Varos's eyes caught the firelight. "But some lessons cannot wait for morning."

"I've had enough lessons for one day."

"This one is different." The elder was silent for a moment, gathering thoughts. "Every wielder before you followed the same path. They discovered the power. They used it. They grew stronger. And eventually, they reached a point where they had to choose: embrace the transformation fully, becoming something beyond human, or fight it and die. None found a third way."

"You're saying I'm going to end up like them."

"I'm saying you could. The power is hungry, Kira. It wants to consume you. Every memory you take, every forging you create, it advances the transformation. You felt it today -- the way the fire demanded more. The way it felt *good* to destroy those who threatened the keepers."

Kira didn't respond. But the truth of it settled in her stomach like ice.

"However." Varos leaned forward. "I have studied the old texts for longer than you've been alive. And there are hints -- fragmentary, uncertain, but present -- of another possibility. Previous wielders sought to master the power through strength, to dominate it the way a blacksmith dominates iron. But the power is not iron. It is fire. And fire cannot be dominated. Only shaped. Only channeled. Only..."

"Surrendered to?"

Varos smiled, and for a moment seemed almost young. "Perhaps. The texts speak of a final forging -- not of memories, but of the power itself. A moment when the wielder gives up everything they have taken, returns it to where it belongs, and closes the door forever. It would mean losing the gift. Possibly losing more than that. But it would also mean remaining human."

"And no one has ever done it."

"No one has ever survived long enough to try. The transformation takes them first, or the cult, or their own despair." Varos's hand found Kira's -- cool against her metallic skin, steady against her trembling. "But you are different. You have something they didn't."

"What?"

"People who will not let you fall." Varos nodded toward the camp, where Tam sat with a group of keepers, bandaging wounds and distributing what food they had. "She followed you into the sanctuary. Fought beside you when she could have fled. There are others who will do the same, I think. You have the capacity to let them."

Kira thought of Tam. Of the keepers who had thanked her. Of the burden Varos was describing -- the impossible weight of carrying memories that weren't hers, of protecting people who couldn't protect themselves, of finding a way to end this that didn't end in her destruction.

"I could walk away," she said. "Disappear into the wilderness. Let the cult hunt me while the keepers escape."

"You could."

"But the power would still consume me."

"Yes."

"And the cult would still find them eventually."

"Almost certainly."

She stared at her hands. The metallic sheen had stabilized, for now, but it waited. The transformation lurked beneath her skin, ready to advance the moment she used the power again.

"The girl," she said. "Sera. Is there any way to restore what was taken?"

"Perhaps. If the memories still exist -- if the cult hasn't destroyed them -- they could theoretically be returned. But it would require power. Knowledge. And time we may not have."

"Then that's where I start." Kira looked up, and something had hardened in her eyes. "I'll learn what you can teach me. I'll protect the keepers. I'll find a way to restore what was taken. And when I've done all that..."

"Yes?"

"I'll find this final forging. And I'll be the first one to survive it."

Varos studied her for a long moment. Then, slowly, the elder nodded. "Every wielder before you said something similar. They believed they would be the exception. They were wrong."

"Maybe I will be too."

"Maybe." Varos rose, joints popping. "But I find myself hoping otherwise. For the first time in many years, I find myself hoping."

The elder walked away, leaving Kira alone with the fire and the weight of everything she'd just accepted.

She thought of Thornhaven, burning. Of her father's forge, now ash. Of Sera's empty eyes and the keepers who had died despite her efforts.

The burden was hers now. The fight. The impossible choice between transformation and surrender.

But she was not alone.

That, perhaps, made all the difference.
