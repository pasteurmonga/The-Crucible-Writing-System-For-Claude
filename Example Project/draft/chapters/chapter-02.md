# Chapter 2: When Memory Burns

## Scene 1: Night Falls Wrong

The dream came for her again.

Kira stood in a corridor of ancient stone, walls stretching up into darkness that had no end. The air tasted of metal and dust, and somewhere ahead, something was waiting. A presence vast and patient. Hungry in a way that had nothing to do with food.

*Come to me.*

The voice wasn't sound. It was pressure behind her eyes, weight on her chest, the certain knowledge that she was meant to be here. That she had always been meant to be here.

*You are mine.*

She tried to run, but her legs wouldn't move. The darkness at the end of the corridor began to pulse, to breathe, to reach for her with fingers made of shadow and stolen light--

Kira woke gasping.

Her small room above the smithy was pitch dark, the fire in the forge below long since banked for the night. She lay still, heart hammering, sweat cooling on her skin. Just a dream. Just the same nightmare that had been plaguing her for months.

But something was wrong.

The wrongness wasn't in the room. It was in the air itself, a heaviness that pressed against her skin like the weight before a thunderstorm. The night was too quiet -- no crickets, no owls, not even the distant lowing of cattle. As if every living thing in Thornhaven had gone silent at once.

Kira pushed herself up and crossed to the window.

The village lay dark and still below her. Most of the torches had guttered out, leaving only the faint glow of the moon to light the empty square. Nothing moved.

Then --

Lights on the northern horizon. Not the warm yellow of fire, but something colder. Something that flickered with colors that hurt to look at, that seemed to shift and pulse like a living thing.

Her hands were shaking.

A stone clinked against her shutters. Then another. Kira unlatched the window and looked down to find Tam standing in the alley below, wrapped in a traveling cloak, face pale in the moonlight.

"You feel it too," Tam said. It wasn't a question.

"Something's coming."

"I couldn't sleep. The dogs won't stop growling. My mother's mare kicked through her stall door an hour ago." Tam's voice was steady, but her eyes kept darting toward the north. "Kira, what did those refugees say about Oakhollow?"

*They come at night.*

Kira grabbed her boots.

By the time she reached the street, the wrongness had deepened. It wasn't just quiet anymore -- it was *hollow*, as if the familiar sounds of night had been scooped out of the world and replaced with nothing.

"We need to wake Elder Maren," Kira said.

"I already tried. She told me to stop jumping at shadows." Tam fell into step beside her, and Kira noticed she'd brought her hunting knife. "But I don't think these are shadows."

They reached the market square just as Old Brem emerged from his carpenter's shop, lantern in hand, nightshirt hastily tucked into his trousers. His face was gray.

"Something's wrong with the animals," he said. "Every horse in the village is trying to bolt. And the birds--" He pointed up.

Kira looked. The sky, which should have been empty at this hour, was alive with movement. Birds -- hundreds of them -- fleeing south in ragged, panicked flocks. Silent. Desperate.

"The lights," Tam whispered.

The cold glow on the northern horizon was brighter now. Closer.

"Get everyone up," Kira heard herself say. "Get them out of their homes. Something is coming."

---

## Scene 2: The Cult Arrives

They came from the dark like ghosts.

Kira was still pounding on doors, shouting warnings no one wanted to hear, when the first of them appeared at the village's edge. Figures in gray robes, faces hidden beneath deep hoods, moving with an unnatural silence that turned her stomach.

They didn't run. They didn't need to.

In their hands, they carried weapons that made no sense -- blades that shimmered with shifting light, edges that seemed to blur and reform with every step. One of them raised a sword, and Kira saw that it wasn't metal at all. It was something else. Something that flickered with images she almost recognized: a face, a voice, a moment frozen in time.

*Memory-forged.*

She didn't know how she knew the word. It simply appeared in her mind, certain as her own name.

The first to fall was Marcus, the baker's son. He'd come stumbling out of his family's shop to see what the commotion was about, still wearing his flour-dusted apron. One of the gray figures turned toward him, smooth and unhurried. The shimmering blade flicked out.

It didn't cut him. It didn't need to.

Marcus froze mid-step. His eyes went wide, then wider, then empty. The light that made him *him* simply... drained away. He stood there, breathing, blinking, alive in every physical sense. But when he opened his mouth, nothing came out. His face was slack, vacant, the face of someone who had forgotten not just his name but the very concept of having one.

His mother screamed.

And then the screaming was everywhere.

The cult moved through Thornhaven with terrible efficiency. They weren't raiders, weren't after gold or livestock or any of the things that drove ordinary violence. They touched people with those strange weapons, and the people became shells. One by one, house by house, the village was being *emptied*.

"Kira!" Tam grabbed her arm. "We have to run!"

But Kira couldn't move. She was watching Elder Maren, the woman who had dismissed the refugee warnings as superstition, stumbling toward one of the gray figures with her hands raised.

"Please," Maren was saying. "We've done nothing. We have nothing you--"

The blade touched her forehead. Just a touch, light as a kiss.

Maren's eyes went vacant.

She stood in the middle of the square, the woman who had settled disputes and guided the village for twenty years, and there was nothing behind her face. Nothing at all.

"They're looking for something." One of the gray figures spoke, voice hollow beneath the hood. "Spread out. Check every building. The source is here."

*The source.*

A chill ran through her that had nothing to do with the night air.

"They're looking for you," Tam breathed. The refugee's words, coming back to haunt them: *They're looking for something. Or someone.*

"That's insane."

"Then why haven't they touched us?" Tam yanked her behind a cart, out of sight. "They walked right past three villagers to get to Maren. They're being selective. And they're all moving toward--"

The smithy.

The cult was converging on Kira's home.

---

## Scene 3: Running and Hiding

They ran.

Through alleys Kira had known since childhood, past houses where her neighbors were screaming or worse, not screaming anymore. The night was chaos now, fire spreading from building to building as knocked-over lanterns caught on thatched roofs, smoke mixing with the strange cold glow of the memory-weapons.

"The forge is gone," Tam panted as they ducked behind the grain silo. "We need to get out of the village."

Kira looked back. Flames were licking up the walls of the smithy, her father's smithy, the only home she'd ever known. Everything she had left of him -- his tools, his letters, the worn leather apron he'd taught her to wear -- all of it burning.

Grief should have come. Rage. But there was no room for either, not now. There was only the cold certainty that if they stopped moving, they would die. Or worse than die.

"The south road," she said. "Through the orchards. The trees will give us cover."

They moved, keeping low, using the fire and chaos as a distraction. The cult wasn't trying to stop people from fleeing -- they were too focused on their search, methodically working through the village block by block. But that wouldn't last. Eventually, they'd finish with the buildings and turn their attention to the runners.

Near the temple, they found what was left of Old Brem.

He was standing in the street, still holding his lantern, its flame long since guttered out. His eyes were open but saw nothing. His mouth moved silently, as if trying to remember how words worked. Around him, three gray figures were conferring.

"Not this one. The gift isn't here."

"The forge was empty. Where did she go?"

"Find her. He wants this one alive."

*He.*

Kira didn't need to ask who they meant. The presence from her dreams, vast and hungry. Waiting.

Tam's hand found hers. Squeezed.

They crept past the temple, past Brem's empty body, past the last house at the village's edge. The orchards stretched before them, dark and inviting. Safety. Escape.

And then they heard the scream.

It was a child's voice. High, terrified, breaking. Coming from the direction of the well.

Kira stopped.

"No." Tam's grip tightened. "Kira, no. We can't--"

"I know that voice." Delia. The miller's daughter. Seven years old. Had watched Kira work the forge a hundred times, fascinated by the fire. "I can't just--"

"They're looking for *you*. If we go back, we die."

Delia screamed again.

Kira looked at her oldest friend. Saw the fear there, the desperate logic, the knowledge that running was the only sane choice.

Then she pulled her hand free and ran toward the scream.

---

## Scene 4: Cornered

Delia was backed against the well, a gray-robed figure looming over her. The child's face was streaked with tears, her small hands raised in useless defense. The cult member's weapon pulsed with that stomach-turning light, already descending toward her forehead.

"No!"

Kira didn't remember deciding to throw herself forward. One moment she was running, the next she was between Delia and the blade, arms spread wide.

The weapon stopped inches from her face.

Up close, she could see the images trapped in its light. Faces she almost recognized. Voices she almost heard. A lifetime of memories forged into something terrible -- someone else's lifetime, someone else's self, taken and shaped into a weapon.

The figure beneath the hood drew back slightly. She caught a glimpse of a face -- human, ordinary, but with eyes that held no warmth.

"There you are."

More of them emerged from the shadows. Four, five, six gray robes closing in. Kira grabbed Delia and pulled her back, but there was nowhere to go. The well behind them, the cult in front, buildings burning on either side.

"Let the child go." Kira's voice came out steadier than she felt. "She's not who you're looking for."

"No." The leader -- if there was a leader -- tilted his head. "She's not. But you are."

Tam burst out of the alley, knife in hand, desperate fury on her face. She made it three steps before one of the cult members turned and caught her blade on that shimmering weapon. The impact sent her stumbling, and another gray figure grabbed her from behind, pinning her arms.

"Tam!"

"Don't fight." The blade was at Tam's throat. "Don't struggle. Just come with us, and your friends will live. Their memories intact, their selves preserved. That's more mercy than most receive."

"What do you want with me?"

The cultist smiled. "You don't know?" He gestured at the destruction around them. "All of this, for someone who doesn't even understand what she is. How delightfully ironic."

The weapon rose toward Tam's forehead.

"Wait!" Kira lunged forward, and two of the cultists grabbed her arms. She struggled, useless against their grip. "Don't touch her. Don't--"

"She'll forget everything. Her family. Her name. The friend she was trying to protect." The leader spoke softly, the way one might soothe a frightened animal. "And then we'll do the same to the child. And to you. And when you're all properly *quieted*, we'll bring you to him."

Tam's eyes met Kira's. Fear, yes. But beneath it, something else. Something defiant.

*Run*, that look said. *Get free somehow. Run.*

The blade touched Tam's forehead.

And the world tore open.

---

## Scene 5: The First Forging

It came from nowhere and everywhere.

A sound that wasn't sound, a light that wasn't light, a *presence* that erupted from somewhere beneath Kira's ribs and tore through her like fire through dry wood. She was screaming, but the sound was lost in the roar of whatever was happening to her.

The world went white.

When she could see again, the cultist holding Tam was gone. Not dead. *Gone*. His robes lay empty on the ground, collapsing in on themselves like a puppet with cut strings. His memory-weapon clattered to the stones, its light extinguished.

In Kira's hands -- she didn't remember reaching for anything -- was something new. Something *made*. A blade of pure light, forged from images and voices and moments she couldn't identify. Someone else's memories, someone else's life, shaped into a weapon by instinct alone.

She had taken them. Without meaning to, without understanding how, she had reached into a human being and *taken*.

And then she had forged.

The remaining cultists scrambled back, their calm confidence shattered. One of them raised his weapon, and Kira felt the pull of it -- felt the memories inside it like songs heard from another room. Felt the hunger of the fire inside her, wanting to take more, forge more, *be* more.

"Forge-touched," one of them whispered. "A true one. After all these years."

"He was right." Another voice, shaking. "He said we'd find another."

Kira advanced, and she didn't recognize herself. Her body moved with a grace she'd never possessed, the weapon in her hands singing as it cut through the air. Another cultist raised his blade to block -- she shattered it, felt the trapped memories scatter like startled birds, reached out and *took* them too.

The second forging was easier than the first.

She didn't make a weapon this time. She made a wave, a pulse, a wall of light that slammed into the remaining cultists and sent them flying. They struck walls and tumbled into rubble, robes smoking, weapons shattered.

And through it all, the fire burned hotter. Hungrier. Wanting more.

*More memories. More power. Take them all. Become what you were always meant to be.*

"Kira?"

Tam's voice. Small and frightened in the sudden silence.

Kira turned. The weapon in her hands was still blazing, casting shadows that danced like living things. In that light, Tam looked terrified. Not of the cultists. Of her.

"Your eyes," Tam whispered. "They're... they're glowing."

Kira looked down at her hands. The skin seemed harder than before, with a faint metallic sheen she'd never noticed. And beneath it, the fire still burned. Still *wanted*.

She dropped the weapon. It dissolved before it hit the ground, memories scattering into nothing.

"I didn't..." Her voice cracked. "I didn't mean to..."

One of the fallen cultists stirred. Groaned. Lifted his head with effort and fixed his eyes on her.

"Another one," he rasped. "He will want to know. Mark the village. Mark the path. The heir has awakened."

Then his eyes rolled back, and he was still.

---

## Scene 6: The Marking

They stood in the ruins of what had been Thornhaven.

Flames still licked at the remaining buildings, casting hellish light across the square. Bodies lay where they'd fallen -- some dead, some worse than dead, still breathing but empty. The cultists had fled or been destroyed, but what they'd left behind was devastation.

"Delia." Kira turned, and the child was still there, curled against the well, eyes screwed shut. "Delia, you need to find somewhere to hide. Do you understand?"

The girl opened her eyes. Looked at Kira. Looked at her hands.

And then she ran, sobbing, disappearing into the smoke.

Kira couldn't blame her.

"We have to go." Tam was pale, shaking, but her voice was steady. "Kira, whatever you did -- whatever you are -- they'll be back. And they'll bring more."

"I know."

But she didn't move. She was staring at her reflection in a puddle of water -- the only clean thing left in the square. Her eyes, normally brown, had a faint metallic shimmer. Her skin, normally warm and human, looked somehow harder. Wrong.

*What am I?*

*What did I do?*

The fire inside her had dimmed, but it hadn't died. She could feel it waiting, patient as a banked coal. Ready to blaze again.

"The refugees talked about memory-keepers," Tam said. "The old stories. Maybe... maybe someone out there knows what's happening to you. Can help."

"They were looking for me." Kira's voice was hollow. "The cult. They called me 'forge-touched.' Said someone wants to know I exist."

"Then we run the other direction."

"And go where?" Kira laughed, and it came out broken. "Everywhere we go, I'll be this. Whatever this is. A killer. A monster."

Tam crossed to her, took her hands. Kira flinched, expecting fear, expecting Tam to pull away.

She didn't.

"I don't know what that was," Tam said. "I don't know what you did, or how. But you saved me. You saved Delia. And you're still you." Her grip tightened. "We need to go. Now. Before they come back."

Kira looked at her oldest friend. Saw the terror she was trying to hide, the confusion, the thousand questions neither of them could answer. But beneath all of it, still, that fierce protectiveness. That refusal to let go.

"I killed them," Kira whispered. "I took something from them and I killed them."

"I know."

"I could do it again. I could--"

"I *know*." Tam pulled her toward the southern edge of the village. "And we'll figure it out. But not here. Not now."

The smithy was a skeleton of flame behind them. The village square was full of the bodies of people Kira had known her whole life. And somewhere in the distance, the sound of hooves -- more cultists coming.

Kira ran.

---

## Scene 7: Flight

They fled south through the orchards, through fields Kira had walked a thousand times, past farmhouses where lights were flickering on as the smoke from Thornhaven became visible. They didn't stop to warn anyone. Didn't stop for anything.

The fire inside her had settled into something almost bearable -- a warm pressure behind her ribs, a constant awareness she couldn't shake. Memories shimmered around her now, faint presences she couldn't ignore. The trees remembered growing. The stones remembered being shaped. Even the air held traces of the people who had passed through it.

She didn't know how she knew this. She didn't want to know.

By the time dawn broke, they'd put miles between themselves and what was left of Thornhaven. Kira's legs were shaking, her lungs burning, and her hands wouldn't stop trembling no matter how hard she clenched them.

Tam called a halt by a stream, and Kira collapsed against a tree, staring at nothing.

"Let me see your eyes."

Kira looked up. Tam was studying her face with an intensity that should have been clinical, but wasn't. Her own eyes were red-rimmed from smoke and tears.

"Better," Tam said finally. "The glow is fading."

"Is it?" Kira looked at her reflection in the stream. Her eyes were almost normal now, just the faintest metallic sheen that could have been a trick of the light. Her skin still felt wrong, but the difference was subtle. Unless you knew what to look for.

"What do we do now?" Tam asked.

Kira had no idea. She'd spent her entire life in Thornhaven, and now Thornhaven was gone. She had a power she didn't understand, a hunger she couldn't control, and enemies who knew her name.

*He will want to know.*

"The refugees came from the north," she said slowly. "They were fleeing toward us. Which means... whatever they were fleeing from, whatever happened in Oakhollow, there might be answers there."

"North is where the cult came from."

"I know."

"That's insane."

"I know." Kira pulled herself to her feet. "But I can't just run forever. And I can't control this -- whatever this is -- without understanding it. Someone has to know. The cult knows. Maybe there are others."

Tam was silent for a long moment. Then she stood too, brushing leaves from her cloak.

"Fine. We go north. But carefully." She met Kira's eyes. "And if you start to glow again, or if you feel that... that hunger... you tell me. Immediately."

"Deal."

They walked on. Behind them, a column of smoke marked where Thornhaven had stood. Ahead, the hills rose toward distant mountains, and somewhere beyond them, answers.

Or death.

At this point, Kira wasn't sure which would be worse.
