# Chapter 1: The Forge Before the Fire

## Scene 1: The Forge at Dawn

The fire spoke to Kira before the sun rose.

In the gray hour before dawn, as she pulled on her leather apron and coaxed the coals back to life, something passed between her and the flames. A settling. A recognition. As if the fire knew her hands, and she knew its hunger.

This morning, like every morning, she'd woken before the first birds. Her small room above the smithy held nothing to keep her -- a narrow bed, a chest of spare clothes, her mother's pendant hanging from a nail. The dreams had been bad again. Places she'd never seen, voices she didn't recognize, a sense of something vast and terrible waiting just beyond the edge of her vision.

Better to work than to lie there and wonder.

The coals caught. Kira fed them carefully, building the heat in layers the way her father had taught her. *Low and slow for shaping. Hot and fast for joining. Never rush the fire, and never ignore it.* His lessons lived in her hands now, muscle memory outlasting the man himself.

She selected a bar of iron from the rack -- a commission from the miller, who needed a new pivot pin for his grain wheel. Simple work. Honest work. The kind of thing she could do with her eyes closed.

The metal glowed orange in the flames. Kira pulled it free with her tongs and set it on the anvil, hammer rising and falling in steady rhythm. Clang. Clang. Clang. The sound echoed off the stone walls, drowning out the quiet.

That was what she wanted. The noise, the heat, the focus. When she was working, she didn't have to think about the hollow space inside her chest. The sense that she was meant for something other than shaping horseshoes and mending pots. The whisper that said *this isn't your life, not really*.

The hammer slipped.

Not much -- just a fraction of an arc, a glancing blow that caught the edge of the metal instead of its face. But her hands had moved on their own, tracing a pattern she hadn't intended. For a moment, the iron shimmered, and the fire in the forge burned a shade brighter than it should.

Kira blinked. The metal sat on the anvil, half-shaped, perfectly normal. The forge crackled softly behind her.

She stared at her hands. Callused palms, nicked fingers, the permanent stain of soot in the creases. They looked the same as always. They felt the same.

*What was that?*

Nothing. She'd been up too early, that was all. Working herself harder than she needed to because the alternative was lying in bed, feeling the weight of things she couldn't name.

Kira plunged the metal back into the coals and waited for the glow to return. Outside, the first gray light of morning crept across Thornhaven's rooftops. Somewhere, a rooster crowed. The village was waking up.

Connection should have stirred in her. Belonging. This had been her home for all twenty years of her life. The people here knew her name, asked after her health, trusted her to mend their tools and shoe their horses.

But when she looked at Thornhaven, all she saw was a place she was waiting to leave.

The problem was, she had no idea where she'd go.

"You're thinking too loud," she muttered to herself, and pulled the iron back to the anvil. "Just work."

The hammer rose. The hammer fell. The metal took shape beneath her hands, becoming what it was supposed to be.

If only she could say the same for herself.

## Scene 2: Morning in the Village

The miller's pivot pin sat cooling in the slack tub when Tam pushed through the smithy's door, a cloth-wrapped bundle in one hand and an expression somewhere between amusement and concern on her face.

"You know," Tam said, stepping carefully around the scattered tools, "most people wait for the sun to actually rise before starting work."

"Most people sleep better than I do." Kira wiped the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smear of soot behind. "What's that?"

"Breakfast." Tam held up the bundle. "My mother made extra. Again. She's convinced you're wasting away."

"I'm fine."

"You're working before dawn and skipping meals." Tam set the bundle on the workbench, her sharp eyes taking in the finished pivot pin, the still-glowing coals, the dark circles under Kira's eyes. "That's not fine. That's... whatever the opposite of fine is."

Kira could have argued. Instead, she unwrapped the bundle to find fresh bread, a wedge of hard cheese, and two apples that still smelled like the orchard. Her stomach growled, betraying her.

"See?" Tam grinned. "Your body knows, even if your head is too stubborn to listen."

They ate sitting on the stone wall outside the smithy, watching Thornhaven shake off the last of the night. Children ran past on their way to morning chores. Old Brem the carpenter opened his workshop across the square, waving at them as he unlocked the door. The baker's chimney sent up a steady plume of smoke, and the smell of fresh bread mingled with the ever-present scent of forge smoke that clung to Kira's clothes.

Thornhaven -- a cluster of buildings where the trade road crossed the stream, too small for most maps but large enough to hold everyone Kira had ever known. And a smithy at its heart, passed down from her father, the same way his father had passed it to him.

"You're doing it again," Tam said.

"Doing what?"

"Looking at everything like you're already gone."

Kira took a bite of apple to avoid answering immediately. Tam knew her too well. They'd been chasing each other through wheat fields since childhood, since before Kira's father got sick, since before everything became the weight it was now.

"I'm just tired," Kira said finally. "The dreams--"

"The dreams again." Tam's expression shifted from teasing to serious. "The same ones?"

"Places I've never been. Things I don't understand." Kira shook her head. "It's nothing. Probably just something I ate."

"For the last three months?"

"I eat a lot of questionable things."

Tam didn't laugh. "Kira. You can talk to me."

But the words wouldn't come. Her chest tightened the way it always did when she tried to explain -- the hollow space, the waiting, the sense that this life was a placeholder for something else. She loved this village. She loved Tam. And still, every morning, she woke up unable to breathe.

"There's nothing to talk about," Kira said. "I'm fine."

"If you say 'fine' one more time, I'm going to push you into the horse trough."

That got a real smile from her. "You could try."

"I've done it before."

"We were twelve."

"And you were just as stubborn then." Tam reached over and squeezed Kira's shoulder. "Whatever it is, you know I'm here. I've always looked out for you. That's not going to change."

Something loosened in her chest, just a little. Tam meant it. She always meant it. That fierce protectiveness had been there since childhood, since the day Kira had gotten lost in the woods and Tam had refused to go home until they found her. Tam was the one person in Thornhaven who saw Kira completely -- the restlessness, the grief she carried, the constant sense of not-quite-fitting -- and stayed anyway.

"I know," Kira said. "Thank you."

They sat in companionable silence for a while, watching the village come to life around them. The market square was filling up now, farmers bringing in early vegetables, traders setting out wares. Everything normal. Everything ordinary.

Then Elder Maren walked past, deep in conversation with one of the farmers, and Kira caught a fragment of what they were saying.

"--memory-keepers, indeed. Next you'll be telling me the old gods are coming back."

"I only said what the travelers told me," the farmer protested. "Strange things happening up north. People forgetting--"

"The old ways died long ago." Maren's voice carried the weight of authority. She was the closest thing Thornhaven had to a leader, the one people went to when disputes needed settling. "Whatever those travelers saw, it wasn't memory-keepers."

They moved out of earshot, but Kira found herself staring after them. Memory-keepers. She'd heard the term before, in stories her father used to tell. People who could hold onto memories that others had lost, who preserved the knowledge of the world before... before something. The stories were never clear on that part.

"You're doing it again," Tam said.

"Sorry. Just..." Kira shook her head. "Nothing. I should get back to work."

"Should I tell my mother you enjoyed breakfast?"

"Tell her I'm eternally grateful and she's the best cook in five villages."

Tam grinned. "She already knows. But she likes to hear it."

She headed off toward her family's farm, and Kira watched her go, that familiar mix of gratitude and guilt churning in her stomach. Tam deserved better than a friend who was always half-present, always looking toward some invisible horizon. But she didn't know how to be anything else.

The market noise swelled around her. Just another morning in Thornhaven.

Why did it feel like a countdown?

## Scene 3: The Wound

The graveyard sat behind the old temple, shaded by a row of oak trees that had been old when Kira's grandmother was young. She went there after the midday meal, as she did most days when the forge work was caught up. Not to pray -- she'd never had much faith in the silent gods -- but to remember.

Her father's marker was simple. Gray stone, carved with his name and the dates of his life. *Aldric, smith of Thornhaven.* No poetry, no grand epitaphs. He wouldn't have wanted them.

Kira sat in the grass beside it, her back against the rough bark of the nearest oak.

"I finished the miller's pin," she said, as if he could hear her. "Clean work. You'd have approved."

No answer, of course. The dead kept their own counsel.

It had been three years since the fever took him. Three years since she'd sat by his bedside and watched the man who'd taught her everything slip away inch by inch, growing thinner and paler until one morning he simply didn't wake up. She'd been seventeen. Too young to run a smithy on her own, everyone said. But she'd done it anyway, because there was no one else, and because stopping would have felt like betraying him.

The grief had dulled over time. But the guilt stayed sharp.

*I couldn't save them.*

Not just her father. Her mother, too, lost to a different fever when Kira was barely old enough to remember her face. Everyone she'd ever loved, taken by forces she couldn't fight.

Something about her drew loss the way iron drew lightning. She'd never told anyone, not even Tam. But she knew. Everyone who got close to her would eventually be taken away.

Footsteps in the grass behind her. Kira didn't turn.

"I thought I'd find you here." Tam's voice, gentle now, without the teasing edge. She settled onto the ground beside Kira, close enough that their shoulders almost touched.

"You don't have to--"

"I know." Tam followed Kira's gaze to the gravestone. "I just thought you might want company."

They sat together in silence. The oak leaves rustled overhead, casting moving shadows across the grass. Somewhere in the distance, a bird sang.

"He'd be proud of you," Tam said finally. "The work you've done. The way you've kept the smithy going."

"Maybe." Kira pulled up a blade of grass, tearing it into small pieces. "Or maybe he'd be disappointed that I'm still here. Still doing the same thing he did. Never going anywhere, never becoming anything more than--"

"Stop."

The sharpness in Tam's voice made Kira look up.

"You do this," Tam said, her dark eyes fierce. "You twist everything into proof that you're not enough. That you don't deserve to be happy. And I'm tired of watching it."

"Tam--"

"Your father loved you. He believed in you. And if he were here right now, he'd tell you to stop punishing yourself for things that were never your fault."

The words hit like a blow. Her throat tightened.

"How do you know what's my fault?" she asked quietly. "How does anyone know? Maybe I'm cursed. Maybe everyone I love--"

"Then I should have died years ago." Tam's hand found hers, grip firm. "We've been friends since we were six. If you were cursed, I'd be dust by now."

Kira couldn't help it -- a small, broken laugh escaped her. "That's not how it works."

"How do you know?"

"I don't. That's the problem."

Tam held her hand tighter. "Then stop guessing and just... live. Be here. Let people care about you." A pause. "Let me care about you."

The afternoon light was golden now, slanting through the oak leaves. Kira looked at her father's grave, then at Tam, and felt the guilt loosen just a fraction of its grip.

She wasn't sure she believed she deserved this. Wasn't sure she ever would.

But maybe she could pretend, just for now.

"Okay," she said. "Okay."

## Scene 4: A Normal Day's End

The evening brought cooler air and the smell of woodsmoke from a dozen chimneys. Kira banked the forge for the night, checking and rechecking the coals the way she always did. *Never leave a fire unattended. Never let the smithy burn down while you're sleeping.* More of her father's lessons, written into her bones.

Tam had stayed for dinner, and now she sat on the workbench, legs swinging, watching Kira move through her closing routine.

"You could come to the gathering tonight," Tam offered. "Brennan's playing his fiddle. There'll be dancing."

"I'm terrible at dancing."

"Which is exactly why you should practice."

Kira hung her hammer on its peg, running her fingers along the worn leather grip. "Maybe another time. I'm tired."

"You're always tired."

"Then I'm especially tired tonight."

Tam sighed but didn't push further. That was one of the things Kira loved about her -- she knew when to press and when to let go. "Fine. But you're coming to the next one. I'm not letting you become a hermit."

"I'm a blacksmith. We're supposed to be solitary and mysterious."

"You're about as mysterious as a turnip."

Kira threw a rag at her. Tam caught it, grinning.

They walked to the smithy's door together, looking out at Thornhaven as the last light faded. Torches were being lit in the market square. Voices drifted from the tavern down the street, laughter and the clink of cups. Normal sounds. Comfortable sounds.

"Do you ever wonder," Kira said, "what's out there? Beyond the trade roads, beyond the maps?"

Tam leaned against the doorframe. "Sometimes. But then I think about leaving my mother's cooking behind and I lose interest."

"I'm serious."

"I know." Tam's voice softened. "And yes, I wonder. Everyone wonders. But wondering and doing are different things."

"What if they weren't?" Kira stared at the distant horizon, where the hills met the darkening sky. "What if one day I just... left? Walked until the road ended and then kept walking?"

"I'd come find you. Drag you back. Probably yell at you for making me worry."

"You're a terrible friend."

"I'm the best friend you've got." Tam pushed off from the doorframe. "Get some sleep, Kira. Real sleep, if you can. And try not to dream about... whatever it is you've been dreaming about."

"I'll try."

She watched Tam walk away, becoming a silhouette against the torchlit square, then a shadow, then nothing. The night sounds swelled around her. Crickets in the grass. An owl somewhere in the trees. The distant lowing of cattle settling down for rest.

Kira should have gone to bed. Should have climbed the stairs to her small room and tried to sleep before the dreams came again.

Instead, she stayed in the doorway, looking at the dark line of the horizon.

She'd been having the same dream for months now. Always the same, though the details shifted. A place she'd never seen -- high walls, ancient stones, air that tasted of dust and something metallic. People moving through corridors that seemed to go on forever. And at the center of it all, a presence. Something vast and patient and *hungry*, waiting for her to find it.

*Or waiting for me to become it.*

The thought appeared unbidden, more terrifying than the dreams themselves.

From somewhere beyond the village, a light flickered. Brief, there and gone, like someone striking a flint in the darkness. Kira blinked, trying to see more clearly, but there was nothing now except the black bulk of the hills.

Probably just a traveler. Someone camping for the night, not wanting to push on to the next village in the dark.

Probably.

She went inside and closed the door behind her.

## Scene 5: Signs of Storm

The strangers arrived as the moon rose.

Kira had given up on sleep -- the dreams were circling again, and she'd learned it was better to stay awake than to fight them -- so she was still in the smithy, sharpening knives by lamplight, when she heard the commotion in the square.

Voices. Raised, urgent, overlapping. Not the sound of celebration or argument, but something else. Something that made her stomach tighten before her mind caught up to what she was hearing.

Fear.

She set down the knife and moved to the window.

A group of people had gathered near the tavern. Most were villagers, pulling on cloaks and rubbing sleep from their eyes. But at the center of the crowd stood four figures Kira didn't recognize. Travel-worn, their clothes stained with dust and something darker. A man, two women, and a child who couldn't have been more than eight.

Their faces...

Kira had seen grief before. Had worn it herself. But this was something else. These people looked *hollowed*, as if something essential had been scooped out of them and nothing had yet rushed in to fill the gap.

She grabbed her lantern and headed outside.

By the time she reached the crowd, Elder Maren had taken charge, her gray hair loose around her shoulders and a shawl clutched over her nightdress. She was speaking to the strangers in a low, calm voice, the same tone she used to settle nervous horses.

"--take you to the temple, get you some food and rest. In the morning we can--"

"There won't be a morning." The woman who spoke was older, weather-lined, her hands shaking where they gripped the child's shoulders. "Not for Oakhollow. Not anymore."

The name sent a ripple through the crowd. Oakhollow was the next village over, half a day's walk to the north. Kira had been there a dozen times, buying iron stock, delivering finished work.

"What happened?" someone asked.

The woman's eyes were too wide, too bright. "They came at night. We didn't even know they were there until... until the screaming started."

"Who came? Bandits? Raiders?"

"They didn't take anything." The man spoke now, his voice flat and distant. "They didn't burn anything. They just... walked through. Touched people. And afterward..." He trailed off, swallowing hard. "Afterward, the people were still there. Still walking, still talking. But they were *empty*. They'd forgotten everything. Their names. Their families. Their whole lives."

Silence.

Cold ran through her, deeper than the night air warranted. *People who forgot themselves.* The same words she'd heard Elder Maren dismiss that morning.

"That's not possible," someone muttered.

"I saw my mother." The child's voice was barely audible. "She looked at me and didn't know who I was."

The crowd shifted, unease spreading. Kira found herself pushing forward, though she didn't know why. The refugees' eyes caught hers, and for a moment the older woman stared at her with an intensity that made her want to step back.

"You," the woman said. "You're the blacksmith."

"Yes. How did you--"

"Your hands." The woman's gaze dropped to Kira's callused fingers, the permanent soot-stains, the small burns. "I'd know a forge-worker anywhere."

"Let me take you somewhere warm," Kira said. "The smithy's got a fire. You can rest there while Elder Maren figures out--"

"They're coming here." The woman's voice dropped to a whisper, but it carried in the sudden quiet. "They were looking for something. Or someone. They asked... they asked about the old ways. About the people who remember."

Tam had appeared at Kira's elbow -- of course she had, she'd never been one to miss a commotion. Her hand found Kira's, squeezing tight.

"Memory-keepers." Elder Maren's voice was sharp. "This is fear talking. There haven't been memory-keepers in a hundred years, and even then they were just stories--"

"They're not stories." The man lifted his head, and there was something terrible in his expression. "I saw what they did. I watched them take my brother's memories and leave him... leave him a shell. They're looking for something. And when they find it..."

He didn't finish. He didn't need to.

The refugee woman was still staring at Kira. "You feel it, don't you? The waiting. The sense that you don't belong."

The words hit like a physical blow.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Kira said, but her voice came out wrong, too high and too fast.

"Whatever you're waiting for -- it's coming." The woman's eyes gleamed in the torchlight. "And when it arrives, nothing will be the same."

Tam pulled Kira back, putting herself between Kira and the strangers. "That's enough. You've had a terrible night. You're not thinking clearly."

"I've never thought more clearly in my life." The woman laughed, a sound without joy. "We ran for two days. Didn't stop, didn't sleep. And the whole time, I knew. They're coming this way. They're looking for something. Or *someone*."

The crowd was murmuring now, fear spreading like ripples in water. Elder Maren took control, directing people to get blankets, to prepare the temple for the refugees, to *calm down* because panic helped no one.

But Kira couldn't hear any of it.

She was staring at the northern horizon, where Oakhollow lay, where something terrible had happened. The darkness there seemed deeper than it should, as if the night itself was holding its breath.

*They're looking for something. Or someone.*

Her hands tingled. For a moment, she could have sworn the fire in the nearest torch burned a shade brighter than it should.

"Kira?" Tam's voice, worried now. "You're shaking."

"I'm fine." The lie came automatically. "Just cold."

But she wasn't cold. She was terrified, in a way she couldn't explain, because somewhere deep in her bones she knew the refugee was right.

Something was coming.

And somehow, impossibly, it was coming for her.
