# Chapter 7: The Line She Crosses

## Scene 1: Under Siege

They moved through the night, abandoning the Hollow of Still Waters.

The scouts had given them six hours before the cult's vanguard arrived. Six hours to pack a lifetime of memories, to carry fragile elders through mountain passes, to become ghosts in the very land that had sheltered them for generations.

Kira led the way, her silver eyes cutting through the darkness like lanterns. The transformation that had been creeping through her now served a purpose -- she could see the trails no one else could, sense the memories embedded in the stone and soil that showed where paths lay hidden.

Behind her came the keepers. Nine of them now, down from the eleven who had survived the sanctuary attack. Two lost to the journey -- one to illness, one to age. Mira supported an elderly man named Callen, whose legs had given out two hours ago but whose mind held memories of the old empire's fall. Garrett carried little Lira on his back, the girl dozing against his shoulder.

And Tam. Always Tam, walking beside her but not quite with her. The distance between them had become a physical thing since their argument, measured in careful silences and avoided glances.

"There." Varos pointed with a gnarled finger toward a darkness in the mountainside. "The old watchtower. It was a sanctuary once, before the empire fell. The stone remembers."

Kira reached out with senses that had grown sharper by the day. The watchtower loomed ahead, half-ruined and overgrown. Memories hummed in its walls -- generations of guardians, watching and protecting. Safe. For now.

They made their way inside as dawn began to gray the eastern sky. The structure was larger than it appeared from outside, tunneling back into the mountain itself. Rooms carved from living rock. Cisterns that still held water. Defensible, Garrett noted with grim satisfaction.

But not impregnable.

"They'll find us," Mira said, once the keepers had settled into the deeper chambers. "Sethren knows the old places. This was never meant to be more than a waystation."

"It buys us time." Varos lowered themselves onto a stone bench. Exhaustion carved new lines in the elder's weathered face, deeper than they'd been even yesterday. The flight had cost them all, but Varos most of all. "Time to think. To plan."

"Plan what?" Garrett's voice was harsh. "We're trapped in a ruin with cult forces closing from three directions. Our only wielder is powerful enough to fight a dozen soldiers but not powerful enough to face Sethren. We have no allies, no resources, no--"

"We have each other." Kira's voice cut through his despair. "We have the memories we carry. And we have something Sethren doesn't expect."

"Which is?"

She didn't have an answer. But she couldn't let them see that.

"Get some rest. I'll take first watch."

---

## Scene 2: A Desperate Option

The cult found them faster than anyone expected.

Three days into their refuge, a patrol stumbled onto their position. The soldiers didn't survive to report back -- Garrett and his scouts saw to that -- but the damage was done. They'd left tracks, and the main force would follow.

Worse, the brief skirmish had wounded one of their own.

Callen lay in the deepest chamber, his breathing shallow and wet. A cult blade had opened his side before Garrett cut down the soldier who wielded it. Mira had done what she could, but they had no supplies, no healers, nothing that could save a man who'd lost that much blood.

"He'll die within the day," Mira said quietly, pulling Kira aside. "And he carries memories we cannot afford to lose. The location of the other sanctuaries. The hidden paths through the mountains. If he dies..."

"The memories die with him."

"Yes."

Kira looked at her hands. The metallic sheen caught the dim torchlight.

"I could take them from him. Preserve them."

"With his consent? He's barely conscious."

"Does that matter? If the memories would be lost anyway?"

Mira was silent for a long moment. "That's... different than what you've done before."

"Is it?" The question tasted bitter in her mouth. "I've taken memories from the dying before. From my father. From the weapon fragments the cult carries. I preserve what would be lost."

"Those were already fading. Already gone. This would be..." Mira looked toward the chamber where Callen lay. "This would be choosing. Taking before the natural end."

"To save something precious."

"Yes." Mira met her eyes. "But where does that line end? Today it's a dying man who can't consent. Tomorrow? Next week? When do you stop?"

Kira had no answer. She turned away, but the question followed her.

---

The patrol they'd killed had carried a prisoner of their own.

They found him bound and gagged in the back of the supply wagon, a cult soldier too wounded to march but too valuable to abandon. Garrett wanted to kill him immediately, but something in the man's eyes made Kira pause.

"Wait."

"Why? He's seen our faces. Knows we're here."

"He knows more than that." Kira crouched before the prisoner, studying him. The insignia on his shoulder marked him as something more than a common soldier -- a courier, perhaps, or a minor officer. "Don't you?"

The man's eyes darted between her and Garrett. Fear, yes. But also defiance.

"I'll tell you nothing, witch."

"Witch." Kira tilted her head. "Is that what they call me?"

"The silver-eyed demon. The memory-thief. They say you steal souls from the living."

"Only from the dead." She paused. "Usually."

The man's defiance flickered. "What do you want?"

"Information. Patrol routes. The position of the main force. Where Sethren is."

"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you."

"Even to save your life?"

"My life ended when your people captured me." The resignation in his voice was genuine. "If you release me, they'll kill me for being taken. If you keep me, eventually I'll be a liability. I'm dead either way."

"Not necessarily."

"What do you mean?"

Kira stood. "Let me worry about that. For now, tell me what you know, and I'll give you what protection I can."

"Your protection?" He laughed, hollow and bitter. "Against Lord Sethren? You might as well protect me from the tide."

She left him with his certainty.

But the problem remained. He had information they needed. Information that could save lives, find escape routes, buy them time. And he wouldn't give it willingly.

There was another way.

The hunger in her whispered: *Take it. Just reach in and pull out what you need. He's the enemy. He doesn't deserve courtesy.*

She pushed the thought aside. But it kept returning.

---

## Scene 3: The Crossing

Callen died at sunset.

Kira held his hand as the last breath left him, felt his memories flutter and scatter like leaves in wind. She tried to catch them -- the sanctuaries, the paths, the knowledge they couldn't afford to lose -- but they slipped through her fingers. Too fast. Too fragmented. By the time his heart stopped, most of what he'd carried was gone.

"Some of it," she told Mira afterward. "Fragments. Not enough."

"His family's faces," the elder woman said softly. "That's what people hold onto at the end. Not maps. Not secrets. Faces."

The loss settled over the keepers like a shroud. Another death. Another piece of their history gone forever.

And outside, the cult was closing in.

Garrett found her an hour later, standing at the watchtower's crumbling parapet. The valley below was dark, but she could see the distant flicker of torches. The main force, making camp for the night. By morning, they'd be close enough to begin the siege.

"The prisoner," Garrett said without preamble. "He knows the patrol patterns. The gaps in their lines. If we had that information, we might slip through before they close the net."

"He won't talk."

"Then make him."

Kira didn't respond.

"You could," Garrett pressed. "I've seen what you can do. Reach in, take what we need, and we escape before dawn. Lives saved. Mission accomplished."

"And the prisoner?"

"Does it matter? He's one of them. He chose his side."

"Did he? Or did the cult give him no choice, the way they gave our villages no choice?"

"That's not--" Garrett broke off, frustrated. "People are dying, Kira. Callen died today. More will die tomorrow if we stay here. You have the power to stop it, and you're hesitating over... what? The comfort of an enemy soldier?"

"Over the line between us and them."

"The line is already blurred. You take memories from weapons. From the dying. From the air itself. What's one more step?"

"The step that makes me into exactly what Sethren is."

Garrett's jaw tightened. "Then let us die on principle. I'm sure that will be very comforting when the cult empties us all."

He left. Kira stayed at the parapet, watching the torches multiply in the darkness below.

*He's not wrong.*

The thought came unbidden, and she couldn't push it away. Garrett was harsh, but he was practical. People were dying. More would die. She had the power to stop it.

All it would cost was her soul.

---

The screaming started at midnight.

One of the keepers -- old Mareth, who carried memories of the first memory-forgers -- woke shrieking from a nightmare that turned out to be real. A cult scouting party had found the lower tunnels. They'd killed two keepers before the alarm raised.

Kira arrived to find Garrett and his scouts fighting a desperate rearguard action. Three cult soldiers down, two more pressing forward. Memory-forged blades flashing in the darkness.

She moved without thought. Shattered the weapons. Disabled the soldiers. Drove them back with a wave of force that left them sprawling.

But not before Mareth fell.

Kira knelt beside the old woman, felt the life draining out of her. Mareth's eyes found hers -- terrified, pleading.

"Take them," Mareth whispered. "Please. Don't let it be lost. The old songs. The first stories. Take them before--"

Her voice cut off. Her heart stopped.

And Kira was too slow again. The memories scattered into nothing.

She knelt there in the blood and darkness, feeling the weight of another failure. Two more keepers dead. Two more lifetimes of memory gone. And the cult was still coming.

Garrett's voice came from behind her. "The prisoner. Now."

She didn't look at him. Didn't speak.

But she stood. And she walked toward where they'd chained the captured soldier.

---

He knew what was coming the moment he saw her face.

"No." The word came out raw with terror. "No, please. I'll talk. I'll tell you everything, just don't--"

"You had your chance to talk." Her voice came out strange, harmonic, echoing with something not quite human. "People died while you held your silence. More will die if you keep it."

"I'll tell you now! The patrols, the positions, anything you want--"

"I don't trust your words anymore."

She reached out.

Tam's voice came from somewhere behind her: "Kira, wait--"

But she didn't wait. Couldn't wait. The rage and grief and desperate necessity all merged into a single burning purpose, and she pushed her consciousness into the soldier's mind like a blade into flesh.

He screamed.

His memories opened before her -- not offered, not shared, but torn open. She saw his childhood (a village not unlike Thornhaven). She saw his conscription (the cult came, and joining was surviving). She saw the faces of fellow soldiers (friends, some of them). She saw patrol routes, troop positions, the gaps in the encirclement that they could use to escape.

She took it all. Everything.

When she pulled back, the soldier's eyes were empty. Not dead -- still breathing, still blinking -- but hollow. The person who had lived behind those eyes was gone, scattered and consumed.

She'd done exactly what the cult did to her village.

Tam was staring at her. Horror carved into every line of her face.

"I had to," Kira heard herself say. "They were dying. They would have--"

"You... you took everything." Tam's voice shook. "He's... there's nothing left."

"The information will save--"

"Is that what you tell yourself?" Tam stepped back. Away from her. "Because that looked exactly like what they did to my parents. To your father. To everyone we loved."

"It's different."

"How?" The word cracked like a whip. "How is it different? He begged you to stop. He offered to talk. And you reached in and emptied him anyway."

"I didn't trust--"

"You didn't want to trust. You wanted to use your power. Wanted to prove you could." Tam's eyes were wet. "The Kira I knew would have found another way. Would have at least tried."

"The Kira you knew couldn't save anyone!"

The words echoed in the sudden silence. Kira heard them, heard the fury and the justification and the desperation in them, and somewhere inside her, something cracked.

Tam stood frozen. Then, slowly, she turned away.

"Where are you going?"

"Away from you." Tam's voice was quiet now. Drained of everything except grief. "Away from whatever you're becoming."

"Tam--"

"Don't. Just... don't." She paused at the doorway. "I'll stay with the keepers. Help with the escape you bought. But you and I..."

She didn't finish. She didn't have to.

Kira stood alone in the darkness, the hollowed soldier slumped before her, and the abyss opened beneath her feet.

---

## Scene 4: Tam Witnesses

She found Tam an hour before dawn, helping Mira pack the last of the supplies.

"The escape route is clear." Her voice came out flat, professional. "There's a gap in their patrol pattern at the eastern pass. We have a three-hour window."

"Thank you." Mira's tone was carefully neutral. "The information you obtained will save many lives."

*The information I stole from a man's mind after destroying him.*

She didn't say it. Didn't need to. Mira knew. Everyone knew.

Tam didn't look at her. Kept packing, kept moving, kept her back turned like a wall.

"Tam."

Nothing.

"We need to talk."

"No." The word was quiet but final. "We don't."

"What I did--"

"What you did was choose." Now Tam turned, and the exhaustion in her face was worse than anger would have been. "You had options. He offered to talk. You could have tried other methods. But you chose the quick way. The powerful way. The way that made you feel in control."

"I was trying to save--"

"I know what you were trying to do. I understand the justification. Desperate times, impossible choices, all the things you're telling yourself right now." Tam's eyes bored into hers. "But understanding isn't forgiving. And I watched you turn a person into an empty shell, and I can't unsee it. I can't unfeel it. That look on his face when you reached in -- that's going to live in my nightmares forever."

"I'm sorry."

"Are you? Or are you sorry that I saw?"

The question hit like a blade. Kira opened her mouth to respond, but no words came. Because the truth was complicated. The truth was that part of her wasn't sorry at all -- part of her was already thinking about the next time, the next desperate moment when this power would be the difference between life and death.

Tam saw it in her face. Of course she did. Tam had always seen her too clearly.

"That's what I thought." Tam turned back to her work. "Go. Lead your escape. Save the keepers. Be the hero everyone needs."

"And you?"

"I'll follow. I promised to help, and I keep my promises." The words were bitter. "But don't expect anything else from me. Not anymore."

Kira stood there for a long moment, hoping for something -- a softening, a sign that this breach could be healed. Nothing came.

She left to prepare the escape.

---

## Scene 5: Breaking the Siege

The route worked perfectly.

They moved through the eastern pass in the gray hour before dawn, a silent line of shadows slipping between the gaps in the cult's encirclement. Kira led, her enhanced senses reading the terrain, warning of danger before it materialized.

The stolen memories guided them true. Every patrol position, every change of guard, every blind spot in the net -- all exactly where the hollowed soldier's knowledge had promised.

By the time the sun crested the mountains, they were clear.

"Three hours' march to the next waypoint," Garrett announced. "A farmstead that shelters travelers. We can rest there."

The keepers moved with renewed energy. Alive. Safe. Because of what she'd done.

"Well done." Mira fell into step beside Kira. "Whatever it cost... the result speaks for itself."

"Does it?"

"Fifteen lives, Kira. Fifteen people who would be dead or emptied if we'd stayed." Mira's voice was gentle. "I won't pretend the method was clean. But I won't pretend the outcome doesn't matter either."

"And the soldier I destroyed?"

"An enemy who chose his side."

"Did he? I saw his memories, Mira. He was conscripted. His village was 'converted' the same way ours was. He wasn't evil. He was surviving."

Mira was silent for a moment. "Then his death is a tragedy. But it's a tragedy the cult created, not you. They put him in that uniform. They made him our enemy. You did what you had to do with the situation they forced."

"That's what Sethren tells himself, isn't it? That everything he does is justified by what came before. That the evil he commits is really someone else's fault."

"I don't know what Sethren tells himself. But I know the difference between a single desperate act and a lifetime of conquest." Mira touched her arm. "You did something terrible. Own that. Learn from it. But don't let it define you. The world is more complicated than heroes and villains."

Kira wanted to believe her. Wanted to believe that a single crossing could be walked back, that lines could be redrawn, that the person she'd been before wasn't lost forever.

But the soldier's memories churned inside her. His face haunted her -- emptied and hollow. His voice echoed, begging her to stop.

Some things couldn't be unfelt.

---

## Scene 6: The Political Ally Arrives

The farmstead turned out to be more than it appeared.

When they approached, exhausted and wary, armed guards emerged from concealed positions. Professional soldiers, not farmers. Their livery was unfamiliar, but their discipline spoke of training far beyond any local militia.

"Hold." A woman's voice, crisp with command. "State your purpose."

"Refugees." Garrett stepped forward, hands carefully visible. "We were told this place offered shelter."

"To whom?" The guards parted, and a figure emerged. A woman, perhaps fifty, with steel-gray hair and eyes that missed nothing. She wore practical traveling clothes, but the quality spoke of wealth. The sword at her hip was ornamental but well-maintained.

Her gaze found Kira. Found the silver eyes, the metallic sheen of her skin. Recognition flickered.

"The wielder." Not a question. "We've been waiting for you."

---

Lady Celene Mirren had been hunting them for weeks.

"Not you specifically," she explained, once they'd been admitted to the farmstead's hidden depths. "But a wielder. Someone who could oppose Sethren. Word reached us of your actions -- the raid on the outpost, the escapes, the growing legend of the silver-eyed woman who fights the cult."

"Word reached whom?" Kira asked.

"Those of us with reason to see Sethren fail." Celene leaned back in her chair, studying Kira with the measured gaze of someone accustomed to assessing threats and opportunities. "The cult's expansion threatens more than memory-keepers, child. It threatens trade, territory, power. Lords and merchants who've carved their domains over generations now find themselves facing an enemy that can rewrite their soldiers' loyalties with a touch."

"You're saying this is about politics? About power?"

"Everything is about power. Surely you've learned that by now." Celene gestured to the soldiers visible through the window. "I represent a coalition of noble houses and merchant guilds with a vested interest in seeing Sethren stopped. We can offer resources. Soldiers. Safe passage. Political protection."

"In exchange for what?"

"Your cooperation. Your abilities directed where they can do the most good -- for all of us."

Kira's jaw tightened. "You want to use me as a weapon."

"I want to point a weapon at a common enemy. There's a difference." Celene's smile held no warmth. "Though I suspect the distinction matters more to you than to me."

"Why should we trust you?"

"Because your alternatives are worse." Celene stood, moving to a map spread across the table. "Sethren's forces have nearly encircled the northern territories. Within a month, there will be no refuge left. Your keepers will be hunted until none remain. Your mentor will die protecting you. And you..." Her finger traced a path to the center of the map, where a fortress was marked in red. "You will face Sethren alone, outmatched, and join the long list of wielders who became what they fought."

"You don't know that."

"I know history. I know how this story usually ends." Celene met her eyes. "I'm offering a different ending. Not a clean one -- politics never is. But a possible one."

Varos spoke from the doorway. "What exactly do you propose?"

"An alliance. Your keepers shelter with my forces. Your wielder coordinates with my generals. Together, we mount a campaign to destroy the Memory Forge before Sethren completes his work."

"And afterward?"

"Afterward, we discuss the new balance of power. With Sethren gone, there will be... opportunities. For all of us."

Kira felt the weight of the decision settling on her shoulders. An alliance with a woman who saw her as a tool, who calculated lives like coins on a ledger. But also soldiers. Resources. A chance.

"I need to discuss this with the others."

"Of course." Celene's smile sharpened. "But don't take too long. Sethren won't wait for consensus."

---

## Scene 7: The Political Rival

The alliance brought complications.

Lord Harren arrived with the second wave of Celene's forces -- a minor noble whose lands bordered cult territory, whose survival depended on picking the winning side. He was young, perhaps thirty, with the soft hands of someone who'd never worked and the hard eyes of someone who'd learned cruelty early.

"The keepers are a liability," he announced at the first strategy meeting. "Every day they remain with the army, they risk exposure. Sethren has agents everywhere. If he learns we're sheltering memory-holders..."

"The keepers are under my protection." Kira's voice carried the harmonic edge that emerged when her power stirred.

"Your protection." Harren's lip curled. "You're a weapon, girl. A useful one, perhaps, but weapons don't make policy. The nobles do."

"The nobles who need that weapon to survive."

"For now." Harren leaned forward. "But wars end. And when this one does, I'd prefer not to be associated with fugitives from a losing cause. If we quietly surrender the keepers to Sethren as a gesture of good faith--"

"No."

"--we might negotiate favorable terms. Our territories preserved, our positions maintained--"

"I said no." Kira stood. The air around her crackled with power barely restrained. "The keepers are not negotiating chips. They're people. The very people this war is meant to protect."

"The war is meant to preserve our power, girl. The keepers are incidental."

Something dark unfurled inside her. The hunger she'd been fighting, the rage that had driven her to cross the line before. This man was a threat. A danger to everything she was fighting for. She could silence him permanently. Reach in, take what made him dangerous, leave him as empty as--

*Stop.*

The thought came from somewhere deep, somewhere that remembered who she was supposed to be. Kira clenched her fists, forced the power down.

"This discussion is over."

"It's over when I say--"

"It's over." Celene's voice cut through the tension. "Lord Harren, you forget yourself. The keepers remain under alliance protection. This was decided before your arrival."

Harren's face flushed. "Lady Celene--"

"Return to your quarters. We'll continue this conversation when tempers have cooled."

He left, but not before shooting Kira a look of pure hatred. A promise of future conflict.

*I could have ended him,* the darkness whispered. *Should have ended him. He'll betray us. They always do.*

Kira pushed it away. But she knew, with cold certainty, that Harren would not let this slight pass.

---

## Scene 8: Mercy 3 -- The Political Rival

She found Harren's spy three nights later.

A servant, one of Celene's household staff, slipping through the darkness toward the perimeter. Kira followed on silent feet, her enhanced senses tracking the woman's wake of memory like a thread through a maze.

The spy met her contact at the edge of the camp -- a cult messenger, dressed as a traveling merchant. Kira watched from the shadows as documents changed hands.

"The keepers' positions, as requested," the spy whispered. "And the wielder's habits. Her weaknesses. Lord Harren believes the information will prove... valuable."

"Lord Sethren will be pleased." The messenger tucked the documents away. "The agreed payment--"

Kira stepped into the moonlight. "Will have to wait."

The messenger ran. The spy froze.

"Please." The woman's terror was immediate and absolute. "I didn't want to -- Lord Harren, he threatened my family--"

"I know." Kira's voice was soft. "I can see it in you. The fear. The desperation. You're not evil. You're surviving."

*Like the soldier I destroyed.*

The messenger was already gone, vanishing into the darkness. It didn't matter. They had all they needed to implicate Harren.

The spy collapsed to her knees. "What are you going to do?"

Kira considered. The woman was a traitor. Had endangered the keepers, the alliance, everything. Justice demanded consequences. The darkness whispered that an example was needed, that mercy here would be seen as weakness, that--

*Some lines I won't cross twice.*

"Get up." She helped the woman to her feet. "Tell me everything about Harren's network. Everyone he's contacted, everything he's planned. And when you're done, take your family and disappear. There are villages in the south that don't ask questions."

"You're... letting me go?"

"I'm giving you a chance to be something other than what you've been forced to be." Kira met her eyes. "Don't waste it."

---

Harren's arrest happened at dawn.

Celene's soldiers surrounded his tent while he slept, and he emerged in chains, sputtering with outrage that quickly turned to fear when he saw the documents laid out before the assembly.

"Treason," Celene pronounced. "Correspondence with the enemy. Attempted betrayal of alliance forces. The penalty is death."

"Wait." Kira stepped forward.

"The wielder objects?" Harren's laugh was bitter. "Going to save me, witch? Add me to your collection of grateful enemies?"

"The wielder suggests... alternative consequences." She turned to Celene. "Death makes a martyr. His allies will claim he was framed, silenced to hide the truth. But exile -- stripped of his lands, his titles, his name -- that tells a different story."

"A story of weakness. The coalition will see us as soft."

"They'll see us as merciful. And in a war against people who destroy minds without conscience, mercy is a weapon." Kira met Harren's eyes. "I could empty you. Take everything you are and leave you a shell. That's what you'd do to me, if our positions were reversed. But I won't. Because I'm not what you think I am."

"Pretty words," Harren spat. "From a monster playing at heroism."

"Maybe. But I'm a monster who's letting you live." She turned away. "Exile him. Let him spend his remaining years knowing he was spared by the weapon he tried to destroy."

Celene considered for a long moment. Then: "Exile it is. Strip his titles, confiscate his lands. He leaves the coalition territories within the week."

The guards dragged Harren away. His curses echoed until they faded into distance.

Garrett appeared at Kira's shoulder. "You know he'll betray us again. First chance he gets."

"Probably."

"Then why?"

"Because I crossed a line a few nights ago. Crossed it and can't uncross it." She watched the sunrise paint the mountains gold. "But I can choose not to cross it again. I can choose to be someone who spares enemies instead of destroying them."

"That's a dangerous choice."

"All my choices are dangerous now." She turned toward the camp, where the keepers waited. "But at least this one lets me look at myself in the morning."

---

## Scene 9: The Weight of Crossing

Night found her alone at the edge of the camp, staring at her hands.

The transformation had advanced again. Metallic veins traced up her forearms like frozen lightning, and her skin held a faint luminescence that only darkness revealed. When she looked at herself in still water, silver eyes stared back -- eyes that saw memories floating in the air like ghosts, that sensed every mind in the camp as a constellation of experience and regret.

She was becoming something inhuman. Something powerful and strange and terrifying.

And she'd used that power to violate a man's mind. To destroy him from within. To do exactly what she'd sworn never to do.

*I told myself I had no choice.*

The justification rang hollow now, in the quiet dark.

*I told myself it was necessary. That lives depended on it. That the end justified the means.*

But the soldier's face wouldn't leave her. The moment of recognition, when he'd understood what she was about to do. The screaming. The emptiness that remained when she pulled away.

*That's what Sethren tells himself, too. That every terrible thing he does is justified by what came before. That the evil he commits is really someone else's fault.*

Varos's footsteps sounded behind her, and then the elder emerged from the shadows. Watching her, she realized. Waiting for this moment.

"You've been avoiding me," Varos said.

"I've been avoiding everyone."

"Yes. But me specifically." The elder settled onto a rock nearby. "You're afraid of what I'll say."

"I'm afraid of what you've already thought."

"And what is that?"

Kira's voice came out raw. "That I've become what you warned me about. That I crossed the line Sethren crossed, and there's no going back."

"Hmm." Varos was quiet for a long moment. "You're not entirely wrong. What you did to that soldier was a violation. A corruption of the gift. The kind of act that pushes the transformation forward, that feeds the hunger inside you."

"Then I am lost."

"I didn't say that." Varos's eyes found hers. "Sethren crossed that line thousands of times. Built an empire on violated minds, on stolen memories, on the wreckage of everything that makes us human. You crossed it once."

"Once is all it takes."

"Once is where it starts. But it's not where it has to end." Varos leaned forward. "The soldier you destroyed -- do you regret it?"

"Yes."

"Good. Hold onto that regret. Feed it. Let it remind you, every day, of what you're capable of becoming." Varos's voice hardened. "Sethren stopped regretting long ago. He convinced himself that his actions were not just necessary but right. That the people he destroyed deserved their fate. You haven't reached that point."

"Yet."

"Yet." Varos nodded. "But 'yet' is not 'inevitably.' Tonight you spared an enemy who would have seen you dead. Yesterday you let a traitor live when killing would have been easier. These choices matter, Kira. They're not enough to erase what you've done -- nothing can do that. But they're proof that the person who feels regret is still in there. Still fighting."

Kira stared at her hands. At the power coursing through veins that were no longer entirely human.

"How do I live with it? With knowing what I'm capable of?"

"The same way anyone lives with knowledge they wish they didn't have." Varos stood, old bones creaking. "One day at a time. One choice at a time. Hoping that the good choices outweigh the bad ones."

"And if they don't?"

"Then you'll have someone there to stop you." Varos's gaze drifted toward the camp, where Tam's silhouette was visible at the edge of the firelight. "If she forgives you. If she can find a way to trust you again."

"I don't know if she can."

"Neither do I." Varos started back toward camp. "But you won't know unless you try. And trying is all any of us can do."

They left Kira alone with the darkness and her thoughts.

The soldier's face wouldn't fade. Probably never would.

But tomorrow would come anyway. And when it did, she would have to choose again -- who to be, what to do, which lines to hold and which to bend.

She couldn't take back what she'd done.

But maybe -- maybe -- she could still decide what she would do next.
