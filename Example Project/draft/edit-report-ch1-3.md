## Developmental Assessment

All three chapters pass developmental review:

- **Structure:** Each chapter accomplishes its narrative purpose
- **Pacing:** Strong hooks, good momentum, effective endings
- **Character Arcs:** Kira's progression from restless smith to burden-bearer is clear
- **Plot Coherence:** Events follow logically; foreshadowing plants pay off appropriately
- **Outline Adherence:** All checklist items from chapter outlines completed

**No structural changes required.**

## Line Editing: Pattern Issues Addressed

### Filter Words Removed
The most common issue across all chapters was filter word usage. These create distance between the reader and the experience.

**Examples fixed:**
- "the iron seemed to shimmer" --> "the iron shimmered"
- "She could feel it" --> Restructured to remove filter
- "She could feel memories around her now" --> "Memories shimmered around her now"
- "Every time she closed her eyes" --> "Every blink brought it back"

### Redundancy Trimmed
- "Just fatigue. She'd been up too early" --> "She'd been up too early" (fatigue implied)
- "She should have felt grief. She should have felt rage." --> "Grief should have come. Rage."

### Rhythm Improvements
- Shortened some constructions for cleaner flow
- Removed unnecessary connective tissue
- Strengthened sentence openings

## Copy Editing Notes

**Consistency verified:**
- Character names spelled consistently throughout
- "Thornhaven" consistent
- "memory-keepers" hyphenation consistent
- POV (close third, Kira) maintained
- Scene break formatting (---) consistent

**No grammar errors found.**

---

## Polish Assessment

**Opening Sentences (all strong):**
- Ch 1: "The fire spoke to Kira before the sun rose." -- Evocative, sets voice
- Ch 2: "The dream came for her again." -- Immediate tension
- Ch 3: "They ran until the sun climbed high and Kira's legs gave out." -- Action, consequence

**Closing Sentences (all effective):**
- Ch 1: "And somehow, impossibly, it was coming for her." -- Forward momentum
- Ch 2: "At this point, Kira wasn't sure which would be worse." -- Uncertainty, stakes
- Ch 3: "That, perhaps, made all the difference." -- Hope, connection

## Recommendations for Future Chapters

Based on patterns observed:

1. **Watch for filter words:** "she felt," "she saw," "she heard," "she could" -- remove where possible
2. **"Should have" constructions:** Often weaken prose; restructure
3. **Double confirmation:** "She knew... had known" patterns -- choose one
4. **Emotion through action:** Already strong, maintain this approach

---

## Conclusion

The first three chapters are now polished and ready for the next phase. The prose adheres to the style profile (Clean Epic Fantasy, propulsive pacing) and the developmental structure matches the chapter outlines.

**Next steps:**
- Continue editing chapters 4-10 using the same process
- Or proceed to manuscript compilation
