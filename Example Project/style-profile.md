## Prose Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- Clear, direct sentences as the baseline
- Vary length for rhythm: short punchy sentences for impact, longer ones for flow
- Action beats drive the prose forward
- Avoid excessive subordinate clauses

### Word Choice
- Concrete, specific nouns and verbs
- Strong verbs over adverbs ("she sprinted" not "she ran quickly")
- Accessible vocabulary -- epic scope doesn't require archaic language
- Sensory details grounded in the POV character's experience

### Paragraphing
- Shorter paragraphs for action and tension
- Dialogue broken up with action beats
- White space is a tool for pacing
- Don't let paragraphs sprawl past 5-6 sentences

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Scene-Level
- Enter scenes late, leave early
- Every scene should have forward momentum
- Cut transitional material that doesn't serve character or plot
- End scenes on hooks or turns when possible

### Chapter-Level
- 10,000 words target, but pacing trumps word count
- Multiple scenes per chapter with varying intensity
- At least one significant development per chapter
- End chapters with momentum toward the next

### Overall
- Keep the story moving
- Introspection earned through action
- World-building woven into movement, not exposition dumps
- Trust the reader to keep up

---

## Dialogue Guidelines

- Natural, character-specific voices
- Subtext over direct statement when possible
- Cut pleasantries and filler ("hello," "goodbye," small talk)
- Use action beats instead of dialogue tags when character is clear
- Keep exchanges punchy -- avoid long monologues

---

## POV Guidelines

**POV:** Close Third Person (Kira)

- Deep in Kira's head but not first person
- We see what she sees, know what she thinks
- Other characters filtered through her perception
- Internal thoughts woven naturally, not italicized unless emphasis needed

---

## What to Avoid

- Purple prose and over-description
- Said-bookisms ("she ejaculated," "he expostulated")
- Excessive adverbs
- Info-dumps disguised as dialogue
- Passive voice (unless intentional for effect)
- Filter words ("she saw," "she felt," "she heard") -- just describe it
- Overuse of em-dashes and semicolons

---

## Emotional Beats

- Earn emotion through situation and action, not adjectives
- Show physical manifestations of feeling
- Restraint makes the big moments hit harder
- Trust the reader to feel without being told what to feel

---

## The Memory Forge Specific

### Magic Description
- Memory-forging should feel visceral and physical
- The transformation has visible, tangible signs
- Power costs should be shown, not just told
- Keep magic grounded in sensory experience

### Action Scenes
- Choreography clear but not over-detailed
- Focus on stakes and character, not just movement
- Use the environment
- Every fight should matter emotionally

### Character Voice
- **Kira:** Practical, restless, carries guilt she doesn't voice
- **Tam:** Warm, protective, direct -- says what they mean
- **Elder Varos:** Calm, measured, speaks in lessons
- **Lord Sethren:** Certain, philosophical, genuinely believes his cause
