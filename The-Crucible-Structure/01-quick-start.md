# Quick Start: The Crucible Structure

## The Core Concept

The Crucible Structure is a narrative framework that treats your protagonist like metal being forged into a blade. Through escalating pressure, impossible choices, and strategic sacrifice, your character is tempered into something new -- not through victory alone, but through what they give up to achieve it.

---

## The Three Strands

Every Crucible story braids three narrative strands that pull against each other:

- **QUEST (External)**: The mission, burden, or objective driving the plot forward
- **FIRE (Internal)**: The power, curse, or transformation reshaping who they are
- **CONSTELLATION (Relational)**: The bonds that anchor or threaten to break them

## The Five Movements

| Movement | % of Story | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| I: Ignition | 10% | Light the forge -- establish stakes and strands |
| II: First Tempering | 20% | Shape through failure -- first major test |
| III: Scattering | 25% | Expand, harden, fragment -- widening conflict |
| IV: Brightest Burning | 25% | Master, gather, choose -- peak capability |
| V: Final Forging | 15% | Converge, fail, transcend -- ultimate sacrifice |
| Coda: Tempered Blade | 5% | Reveal what was made |

## Forge Points

Forge Points are crisis moments where all three strands collide simultaneously. The protagonist cannot satisfy all three -- they must sacrifice one strand to preserve the others. These forced choices reveal character and drive irreversible change.

---

## The Forging Metaphor

Just as a blade requires heat, hammering, and quenching to become strong, your protagonist requires:

- **Heat**: Pressure that makes them malleable to change
- **Hammering**: Repeated blows that shape their form
- **Quenching**: Rapid cooling that locks in transformation

The story's job is to apply these forces until what emerges is fundamentally different from what entered.
