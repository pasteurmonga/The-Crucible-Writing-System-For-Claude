## THREE STRANDS (Weave Throughout)

| Strand | Focus | Core Question |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Quest** | External goal, plot engine | What must be achieved? |
| **Fire** | Internal wound, transformation | What must be surrendered? |
| **Constellation** | Relationships, community | Who shapes the journey? |

---

## FORGE POINTS (One Strand Sacrificed Each)

| Point | Location | Pattern |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **FP1** | End of Ignition (~10%) | Quest sacrificed for Fire/Constellation |
| **FP2** | End of Tempering (~30%) | Constellation sacrificed for Quest/Fire |
| **FP3** | End of Scattering (~55%) | Fire sacrificed for Quest/Constellation |
| **FP4** | End of Burning (~80%) | Quest sacrificed for Fire/Constellation |
| **Apex** | Final Movement (~90%) | All three fuse - transformation complete |

---

## MERCY ENGINE (4 Mercies Required)

```
+------------------+----------------------------------+
| Mercy Given      | Must cost something real         |
| Mercy Paid Off   | Returns transformed at crisis    |
| Mercy Received   | Creates binding obligation       |
| Mercy Refused    | Haunts until resolution          |
+------------------+----------------------------------+
```

---

## DARK MIRROR (Antagonist Requirements)

1. **Comprehensible Path** - Reader understands how they became this
2. **Shared Wound** - Same injury as protagonist, different response
3. **Valid Critique** - Their accusation contains truth protagonist must face

---

## THREE CURRENCIES

| Currency | Gained By | Spent On |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Power** | Training, victories | Quest advancement, protection |
| **Humanity** | Mercy, bonds, vulnerability | Resisting corruption, inspiring loyalty |
| **Time** | Victories, efficiency | Everything (always depletes) |

---

## CORE RULES

- Forge Points require genuine sacrifice of one strand
- Mercy always costs; mercy always pays off
- Antagonist must offer a comprehensible dark path
- Victory comes through surrender, not strength
- The wound becomes the gift
- Death must mean something (never cheap)
- Transformation is irreversible
- The blade revealed in Coda was forged by the whole journey

---

## MOVEMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Ignition: Wound exposed, quest accepted, stakes established
- [ ] Tempering: First failure, new allies, methods challenged
- [ ] Scattering: World expands, protagonist hardens, costs mount
- [ ] Burning: Mastery gained, forces gather, dark mirror confronted
- [ ] Final: Ultimate failure, surrender, transformation
- [ ] Coda: New blade revealed, changed world reflected
