## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read alongside blank worksheets** - Compare to understand what each field requires
2. **Note the specificity** - Good planning is concrete, not vague
3. **See the connections** - Watch how elements cross-reference each other
4. **Adapt, don't copy** - Your story should have its own identity
