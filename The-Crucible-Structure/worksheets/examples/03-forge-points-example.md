# Forge Points Worksheet - EXAMPLE

**Story:** The Memory Forge

---

## FP0: Ignition Forge (~10%)

**Location:** 10% of story / Chapter 2

**Quest Crisis (external threat):**

The cult attacks Kira's village, seeking the memory-keepers hiding nearby and sensing her latent power. They come with fire and memory-weapons. Her home (the forge), her community, and her identity as a simple blacksmith are destroyed.

**Fire Crisis (internal struggle):**

In absolute terror, her latent power erupts unbidden. She forges something -- a weapon made of stolen memory -- and it saves her life. But she horrifies herself. The first physical changes have begun. She has killed with her gift.

**Constellation Crisis (relationship stakes):**

Her intimate world is destroyed. The village community she knew is gone. Only Tam, her childhood friend, survives with her. Her old identity and all her ordinary relationships are stripped away.

**What is sacrificed:**

Her ordinary life. Her identity as a simple blacksmith. Her belief that the world makes sense. Her ability to return to who she was.

**Consequence of this sacrifice:**

She is now marked -- the cult knows what she is. She cannot go back to being a simple blacksmith because she is no longer one. She must flee, and this flight leads her to the memory-keepers and the mentor.

---

## FP1: First Crucible (~30%)

**Location:** 30% of story / Chapter 3

**Quest Crisis (external threat):**

Having stumbled upon the memory-keepers while fleeing, Kira discovers the cult is close behind. She cannot save everyone. She must choose: stay and fight (risking capture or death) or flee (abandoning people to their fate).

**Fire Crisis (internal struggle):**

Her power is still raw and uncontrolled. She uses it in the fight, but it is dangerous to herself and others. The physical changes from its use are visible now. She sees what she might become.

**Constellation Crisis (relationship stakes):**

She meets Elder Varos (the mentor) who begins teaching her. Tam supports her decision but cannot help with supernatural combat. Some keepers die despite her efforts -- those who survive are now bound to her.

**What is sacrificed:**

Some of the memory-keepers die because she wasn't ready. Despite her best efforts, she cannot protect them all. She learns that good intentions don't equal good outcomes.

**Consequence of this sacrifice:**

She formally accepts the burden of protecting the keepers. The guilt of those she couldn't save drives her to train harder. She has a burden (survivors), a guide (mentor), a companion (Tam), and a wound (the deaths she witnessed).

## FP2: Second Crucible (~55%)

**Location:** 55% of story / Chapter 8

**Quest Crisis (external threat):**

Political complications endanger the keepers. Lord Harren attempts betrayal. A siege threatens their refuge. She must make ruthless choices to protect the keepers and escape.

**Fire Crisis (internal struggle):**

She crosses the line -- using someone's memories without consent to gain critical information. She justifies it (the stakes are high, the cause is just) but the act is the same as what the cult does. Her transformation is now visible to everyone.

**Constellation Crisis (relationship stakes):**

Tam witnesses her cross the moral line and turns away. He leaves not to join the enemy but to stop enabling her. The mentor warns her she is following the path of all who came before. Lady Celene joins as political ally but cannot replace the intimate connection.

**What is sacrificed:**

Her core bond with Tam. Her moral certainty. Her belief that she can fight the enemy without becoming the enemy.

**Consequence of this sacrifice:**

She is more powerful than ever but profoundly isolated. The mentor's warnings are confirmed. Doubt is planted. She trades the friend for an army -- useful but not intimate.

---

## FP3: Third Crucible (~75%)

**Location:** 75% of story / Chapter 9

**Quest Crisis (external threat):**

The cult leader has found them. In direct confrontation, Kira's power is outmatched. The cult leader's mastery far exceeds hers. She is going to lose.

**Fire Crisis (internal struggle):**

She must accept a painful truth: she cannot master the power through strength. The only way to stop the cycle is to end it, not master it. She has the same potential for evil as the cult leader. The friend was right about what she was becoming.

**Constellation Crisis (relationship stakes):**

Elder Varos sacrifices themselves to save her, demonstrating surrender as strength. In death, they give her time, example, knowledge, and freedom. Tam returns not because she deserves it but because love persists.

**What is sacrificed:**

The mentor dies. Her pride and self-reliance must be surrendered. She must ask for help -- from the political ally, the keepers, and eventually the returning Tam.

**Consequence of this sacrifice:**

She has the truth (painful but necessary), the constellation reassembled, resources gathered (including mercy recipients' aid), and a path forward. All that remains is to walk into the fire and choose.

---

## Apex: Willed Surrender (~85%)

**Location:** 85% of story / Chapter 10

**Quest Crisis (external threat):**

Everything converges: keepers are gathered, cult leader makes final move, political ally's forces are engaged, mercy recipients return as unexpected agents. The cult leader offers alliance against a greater threat.

**Fire Crisis (internal struggle):**

The cult leader's offer is tempting -- it would end the fighting and suffering. But accepting means becoming what she fought against, betraying the keepers, proving the cult leader right that everyone chooses power eventually. She must choose differently.

**Constellation Crisis (relationship stakes):**

Tam is at her side for the surrender. All four mercy recipients return to help. The mentor's lesson is lived. The choice she makes will determine not just her fate but the fate of everyone who trusted her.

**What is sacrificed:**

Her power itself. She uses the gift one final time -- not to take but to give, not to forge a weapon but to seal the cycle. She pours everything into breaking the cycle of memory-forging forever. She becomes ordinary, vulnerable, mortal.

**Consequence of this sacrifice:**

The cycle is broken -- no more memory-forgers can be made. The cult leader is defeated through choice, not power. Her transformation reverses (she becomes fully human again). She emerges as guardian of the scattered keepers, without power but with purpose.

## Notes

The Forge Points escalate in scope: FP0 destroys her old world, FP1 gives her a new burden, FP2 breaks her core relationship, FP3 kills her mentor, and Apex requires surrendering her power. Each sacrifice is greater than the last. The theme is proved at each point: her choices (not her power) define who she is.
