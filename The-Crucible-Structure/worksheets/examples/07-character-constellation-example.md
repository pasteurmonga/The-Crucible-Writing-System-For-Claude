# Character Constellation Worksheet - EXAMPLE

**Story:** The Memory Forge

---

## Protagonist

**Name:** Kira

**Role:** Protagonist, young blacksmith, memory-forger, guardian

**Core Want:** To protect the people she cares about from the cult's destruction.

**Core Need:** To believe she is worthy of good things and that loving doesn't mean losing.

**Arc Summary:**

Kira begins as a restless village blacksmith haunted by past loss, believing she is not worthy of good things. When her power awakens during the cult's attack, she is terrified of what she is becoming. She grows in power but also crosses moral lines, eventually using memories without consent. After losing Tam and then the mentor, she must surrender her power entirely to break the cycle. She ends as a guardian without power but with purpose, finally believing that identity is choice.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 2: Power erupts during village attack, first forging, horror at what she did

2. Chapter 8: Crosses the line by using memories without consent, Tam leaves

3. Chapter 10: Surrenders power to break the cycle, becomes fully human again

---

## Major Character 1

**Name:** Tam

**Role in Story:** The Faithful, childhood friend, emotional anchor

**Relationship to Protagonist:**

Kira's oldest and closest friend, the one who won't abandon her. Tam has always been her defender -- loyal to a fault, physical in his love (actions over words), brave in ordinary ways. He is her connection to who she was before the power.

**Arc Summary:**

Tam survives the attack with Kira and supports her journey. As she grows in power, he feels increasingly inadequate -- he cannot fight memory-forgers or help with her transformation. He watches her change with growing fear. When he witnesses her cross the moral line, he can no longer pretend she is the person he knew. He leaves not to betray her but to stop enabling her. He returns when she is at her lowest, proving that the bond survived everything.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 2: Present during Ignition, first to see her power

2. Chapter 8: Witnesses her use memories without consent, confronts her, leaves

3. Chapter 10: Returns when she's about to fall, at her side for the surrender

---

## Major Character 2

**Name:** Elder Varos

**Role in Story:** Mentor, guide, model of surrender

**Relationship to Protagonist:**

Kira's teacher in the ways of memory-forging. Varos is ancient, calm in crisis, carrying their own history with the power -- perhaps a former wielder who found another way. They teach her control but more importantly, teach her that surrender is strength.

**Arc Summary:**

Varos meets Kira among the memory-keepers and recognizes her power. They begin teaching her -- the history of memory-forging, techniques to control the power, warnings about the fate of previous wielders. Throughout the story, they watch her grow stronger but also harder. They speak truth about what she is becoming. At the Third Forge Point, they sacrifice themselves to save her from the cult leader, demonstrating in death what they could not teach in life: surrender is not losing, it is choosing what matters.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 3: Meets Kira among keepers, begins teaching

2. Chapter 7: Warns her about the path she's taking, sees her hardening

3. Chapter 9: Sacrifices themselves to save her, demonstrates surrender as strength

---

## Major Character 3

**Name:** Lady Celene Mirren

**Role in Story:** Political ally, brings resources

**Relationship to Protagonist:**

A noble who opposes the cult for political reasons and sees Kira as a valuable weapon. Celene leads a coalition of noble houses and merchant guilds. She is steel-gray hair, perhaps fifty, with sharp eyes that miss nothing. She provides military forces, political cover, and resources, but views Kira strategically rather than personally.

**Arc Summary:**

Lady Celene joins the alliance in Movement III after seeing Kira's power demonstrated. She provides a farmstead refuge, military support, and political connections. Her agenda doesn't always align with protecting the keepers -- she sees opportunity in the conflict. She is frustrated by Kira's mercies (especially exiling Lord Harren instead of executing him). At the Apex, her forces provide crucial military support. She represents what Kira could become if she let power define her relationships.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 7: Meets Kira after escape from siege, offers alliance

2. Chapter 8: Objects to sparing Captain Theron, sees it as weakness

3. Chapter 10: Her forces hold the line at the Apex

---

## Major Character 4

**Name:** Sethren

**Role in Story:** Antagonist, dark mirror, cult leader

**Relationship to Protagonist:**

Kira's shadow self -- same power, different choices. Sethren and Kira share the memory-forging gift, possibly from the same bloodline or origin. He chose power over love when tested, sacrificing his sister. Now he leads a cult seeking to erase the old ways, believing memory is a prison. He is what Kira could become if she makes the wrong choices.

**Arc Summary:**

Sethren begins as a distant threat whose forces attack Kira's village. He becomes more personal as Kira learns their shared origin. He pursues her, traps her, offers her alliance. At the Apex, he makes his final offer: join him and reshape the world. She rejects him by surrendering her power entirely. He cannot comprehend this choice and is ultimately defeated. His death is tragic -- he could have chosen differently.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 2: His forces destroy Kira's village (off-stage)

2. Chapter 9: Offers alliance against a greater threat

3. Chapter 10: Final confrontation, cannot understand her surrender, defeated

---

## Major Character 5

**Name:** Captain Theron (Mercy 4 Recipient)

**Role in Story:** Cult lieutenant, unexpected agent at Apex

**Relationship to Protagonist:**

A twenty-year veteran of Sethren's forces, loyal from genuine belief. He sees Sethren's plan as salvation, not destruction. He witnessed Sethren's sister die and understands his motivation. When Kira spares him, he is confused -- her mercy doesn't fit his worldview.

**Arc Summary:**

Theron is captured during a convoy raid in Chapter 8. Kira spares him and sends him back to Sethren with a message. This mercy haunts him. At the Apex, when his orders would require stopping Kira, he hesitates. His confusion about her mercy creates the opening she needs. He represents how mercy transforms enemies into allies.

**Key Scenes:**

1. Chapter 8: Captured and spared by Kira after convoy raid

2. Chapter 10: Hesitates at crucial moment, allowing Kira to reach Sethren

3. Chapter 10: Survives, his loyalty to Sethren broken by Kira's choices

## Notes

- **Tam** is the emotional anchor -- his presence/absence tracks Kira's moral state
- **Elder Varos** dies to model surrender, completing their teaching arc
- **Lady Celene** represents strategic thinking without emotional connection
- **Sethren** is the dark mirror -- same origin, different choices
- **Captain Theron** is the mercy engine's culmination -- enemy becomes ally
- **Memory-keepers** are the burden, not individual characters but collective weight
- **Lord Harren** (Mercy 3) appears briefly but returns with forces at Apex

The constellation expands and contracts:
- Chapters 1-2: Intimate (village, Tam)
- Chapters 3-5: Growing (keepers, mentor)
- Chapters 6-8: Complex (ally, rival, strain)
- Chapter 9: Broken (friend gone, mentor dead)
- Chapter 10: Reassembled (all threads return)
