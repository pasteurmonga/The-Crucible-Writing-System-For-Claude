# Three Strands Worksheet - EXAMPLE

**Story:** The Memory Forge

---

## Strand 1: The Quest (External Plot)

**Summary (one paragraph):**

Kira must protect the last memory-keepers from a cult that seeks to destroy the old ways. After her village is attacked and her power awakens, she discovers that the memory-keepers are the only people who preserve knowledge that the cult fears. Throughout the story, she gathers allies, fights the cult's forces, and ultimately confronts the cult leader. Her victory comes not through overpowering the enemy but through sacrificing her power to break the cycle of memory-forging forever.

**Starting State:** Simple village blacksmith with no knowledge of memory-keepers or the cult.

**Ending State:** Guardian of the scattered keepers, powerless but purposeful.

**Key Moments:**

1. Village attack reveals the cult's existence and awakens her power

2. Discovering the memory-keepers and accepting responsibility to protect them

3. Political alliance brings resources but moral compromise

4. Siege and escape -- keepers endangered by her choices

5. Final confrontation where she sacrifices her power to break the cycle

**How it interacts with Fire strand:**

The burden of protecting the keepers forces Kira to use her power more frequently, accelerating her transformation. Each time she uses memory-forging to protect them, she becomes more like the enemy. The Quest provides the external pressure that drives the Fire's escalation.

**How it interacts with Constellation strand:**

The keepers become part of Kira's constellation -- people she is bound to protect. Her choices about how to protect them strain her relationship with her childhood friend and mentor. The political ally joins specifically because of the Quest, not personal connection.

## Strand 2: The Fire (Internal Transformation)

**Summary (one paragraph):**

Kira's memory-forging power transforms her physically and morally with each use. She begins as an unwitting wielder, terrified of what she can do. As she learns control, she grows more powerful but also more willing to cross moral lines. She uses memories without consent, becoming what she fights against. Only by surrendering the power entirely can she escape the transformation and prove that identity is choice.

**Starting State (protagonist's flaw/wound):**

Kira believes she is not worthy of good things. A past loss taught her that loving means losing. She is restless but trapped, guarded, reluctant to connect deeply. This wound makes her vulnerable to the power's seduction -- if she cannot have love, at least she can have strength.

**Ending State (who they become):**

Kira becomes someone who chooses connection over power. She surrenders her gift entirely, becoming fully human again. She is no longer defined by what she can do but by what she chose to protect. She accepts that identity is forged through choices, not inherited through power.

**Key Moments:**

1. First manifestation -- power erupts unbidden during village attack, horrifying her

2. Learning control from the mentor, seeing what she might become

3. The Crossing -- using memories without consent, becoming what she feared

4. The mentor's sacrifice demonstrating that surrender is strength

5. Final surrender of power to break the cycle forever

**How it interacts with Quest strand:**

The external threat forces her to use her power, which accelerates the internal transformation. She cannot protect the keepers without becoming more like the cult. This creates an impossible tension that is only resolved through surrender.

**How it interacts with Constellation strand:**

Her transformation strains every relationship. Her friend watches her change and eventually turns away. Her mentor warns her repeatedly. Even the keepers she protects fear what she is becoming. Only by surrendering the power does she restore these bonds.

## Strand 3: The Constellation (Relationships)

**Summary (one paragraph):**

Kira's intimate world is destroyed by the village attack, leaving only her childhood friend Tam. She gains new relationships: the mentor Elder Varos who teaches her, the memory-keepers she protects, and the political ally Lady Celene who brings resources. Her transformation drives Tam away after he witnesses her cross a moral line. The mentor's sacrificial death breaks her despair. Tam returns when she is about to fall. At the Apex, the four mercy recipients return as unexpected agents, proving that compassion creates connection.

**Starting State (initial relationships):**

Village community (destroyed), childhood friend Tam (sole survivor of intimate world).

**Ending State (transformed relationships):**

Friend restored, mentor dead but lessons lived, keepers scattered but protected, mercy recipients integrated into constellation, connected by choice rather than circumstance.

**Key Moments:**

1. Ignition destroys her village -- only Tam survives with her

2. Meeting the mentor and keepers, forming new bonds

3. Tam's departure after witnessing her cross the line

4. Mentor's sacrifice to save her, final lesson in action

5. Tam's return, mercy recipients arriving as unexpected agents at Apex

**How it interacts with Quest strand:**

The people she protects become her constellation. The political ally joins for Quest reasons. The mercy recipients are initially enemies encountered through the Quest who become allies through her choices.

**How it interacts with Fire strand:**

Her transformation strains every relationship. The closer she gets to mastering the power, the more she loses the people who matter. Surrendering the power is what allows her to restore the constellation.

## Notes

All three strands converge at every Forge Point. The Quest provides external pressure, the Fire tracks internal cost, and the Constellation shows what is at stake relationally. The theme (identity is choice) is proven through all three: she chooses what to protect (Quest), who to become (Fire), and who to love (Constellation).
