# Dark Mirror Worksheet - EXAMPLE

**Story:** The Memory Forge

---

## Antagonist Identity

**Name:** Sethren

**Role/Title:** Cult Leader, Master of the Memory-Forge

**One-sentence description:**

A former memory-forger who chose power over love and now seeks to erase the old ways, believing that destroying collective memory will liberate humanity from cycles of pain.

---

## The Mirror Parallel

**What protagonist and antagonist share in common:**

Both Kira and Sethren carry the memory-forging gift. They may be from the same village (or one nearby), of the same bloodline, or trained by the same tradition. They are marked by the same ancient conflict. The parallel is close enough to be uncomfortable -- looking at Sethren, Kira sees herself.

**The Divergence Point (where their paths split):**

At some point in the past, Sethren faced a choice similar to Kira's journey. He could save someone he loved (his sister) or gain greater power. He chose power. His sister died -- perhaps sacrificed, perhaps abandoned. From that moment, Sethren's path was set.

**What choice did antagonist make that protagonist must refuse?**

Sethren chose power over connection when tested. He sacrificed love for strength. Kira must refuse this same choice -- when offered alliance and power at the Apex, she must choose differently. She must surrender power to preserve connection.

## Philosophy and Worldview

**Antagonist's core belief (their kernel of truth):**

"Memory is a prison. The old ways trap people in cycles of pain and conflict. If the memories were erased, people could start fresh. My mission is liberation, not destruction."

**Why this belief is partially valid:**

There is truth in this. Memories do trap people. Old grudges, old hatreds, old traumas are passed down through generations. The old ways do perpetuate conflict. Kira should feel the pull of this argument -- she has seen how memory of ancient wrongs fuels present violence.

**Why this belief is ultimately flawed:**

Identity without memory is not liberation -- it's erasure. Sethren's solution destroys people to save them. Choice without memory is not true choice. By erasing memory, he doesn't free people; he unmakes them. The past cannot be escaped by forgetting it -- only by choosing differently within it.

**How antagonist justifies their actions:**

Sethren was wronged. The memories he wants destroyed include memories of what was done to him, his family, his people. His mission is personal vengeance disguised as philosophy. The memory-keepers preserved the stories that condemned his bloodline. He sees himself as a liberator, not a destroyer.

## The Offer (Beat 26)

**What does the antagonist offer the protagonist?**

Alliance against a greater threat. "There is something worse coming. We need each other." Partnership instead of conflict. "Join me and we can reshape the world together." Understanding and training. "You've seen what you're becoming. I can teach you to control it."

**Why is this offer tempting?**

Kira is tired. The transformation is painful. Sethren is powerful and knowledgeable. Accepting would mean: no more running, no more friends dying, an end to the war, answers about her power, and an end to the transformation that terrifies her.

**What would protagonist have to sacrifice to accept?**

Becoming what she fought against. Betraying the keepers she swore to protect. Proving that everyone chooses power eventually. Being defined by her power rather than her choices. Losing Tam, the mentor's sacrifice becoming meaningless, and her identity.

**How does protagonist refuse?**

Not with power, not with argument, but with choice. She chooses differently than Sethren chose. She surrenders her power entirely -- using the gift one final time not to take but to give, breaking the cycle forever. Her refusal is not defeating him but becoming something he cannot understand.

## Antagonist's Arc

**Starting position (power/status):**

Leader of a powerful cult with many memory-forgers under his command. Master of the memory-forge with decades of experience. Politically connected (some nobles fear or serve him). Possesses knowledge of the gift that far exceeds Kira's.

**Key moments of conflict with protagonist:**

1. Village attack (Chapter 2) -- Sethren's forces destroy Kira's home, awakening her power. He learns of her existence.

2. Pursuit and first encounter (Movement II) -- Sethren confronts Kira directly, revealing their shared origin. Horror and recognition.

3. The siege (Movement III) -- Sethren traps Kira and the keepers, forcing desperate choices that harden her.

**Final confrontation:**

At the Apex (Chapter 10), Sethren makes his offer. Kira rejects it by surrendering her power, breaking the cycle. Sethren cannot understand why anyone would give up power. This incomprehension is his weakness -- he has forgotten that there are things more valuable than power.

**How antagonist is defeated:**

Not out-fought but out-chosen. Kira's surrender breaks the cycle of memory-forging. No new memory-forgers can be made. Sethren's long-term plan is ruined. His power fades as the source is sealed. He is defeated by conventional means (the mercy recipients' forces) or chooses death over powerlessness.

**Fate (death/redemption/imprisonment/escape):**

Death -- earned and tragic, a consequence of his choices. He could have chosen differently. He was not born evil. Same origin, different choices. His death is the end of a tragedy, not a victory. He is the road not taken, the fate Kira escaped.
