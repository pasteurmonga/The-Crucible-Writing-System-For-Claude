## Step 1: Story Foundation (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Establish your premise, theme, and targets before anything else.

### 1.1 Start with Your Premise

Write your story in one sentence (25 words or less). This forces clarity.

**Formula:** [Protagonist] must [goal] before [consequence].

**Examples:**
- "A young blacksmith discovers she can forge weapons that steal memories, and must choose whether to become the weapon or its guardian."
- "A disgraced knight must protect the child-heir of the king he failed, crossing a war-torn kingdom before winter closes the passes."

**Your turn:** Write your premise. If it takes more than 25 words, you don't know your story yet. That's fine -- write a longer version, then cut.

### 1.2 Find Your Theme

Your theme is the argument your story makes about human nature. It should be debatable -- reasonable people could disagree.

**Formula:** [Abstract concept] is [claim about it].

**Examples:**
- "Identity is choice, not origin."
- "Love requires sacrifice, but sacrifice is not love."
- "Power corrupts, but powerlessness corrupts absolutely."

**Test your theme:** Can your antagonist believe the opposite? If not, it's not a theme -- it's a platitude.

### 1.3 Set Your Targets

| Element | Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Word Count | 80,000-120,000 | Epic fantasy sweet spot |
| Chapter Count | 18-35 | See Beat-to-Chapter Mapping |
| POV Style | Third Limited | Most common for epic fantasy |
| Tense | Past | Industry standard |

**Worksheet:** Fill out [01-story-foundation-worksheet.md](worksheets/01-story-foundation-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [01-story-foundation-example.md](worksheets/examples/01-story-foundation-example.md)

---

## Step 2: Three Strands (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Map the three narrative threads that will weave through your story.

### 2.1 The Quest Strand (External Plot)

**Question:** What external goal must your protagonist achieve?

This is the visible journey -- the thing that would appear in a movie trailer. It involves:
- A clear objective (save someone, find something, stop something)
- Observable progress and setbacks
- Stakes that affect the world, not just the protagonist

**Write:**
- Starting state (where does the Quest begin?)
- Ending state (what does success look like?)
- Five key moments along the way

### 2.2 The Fire Strand (Internal Transformation)

**Question:** How does your protagonist change inside?

This is the invisible journey -- the character arc. It involves:
- A flaw or wound they carry at the start
- A lie they believe about themselves or the world
- A transformation that costs them something

**Write:**
- The wound/flaw (what limits them at the start?)
- The lie they believe
- Who they become by the end
- Five key moments of internal change

### 2.3 The Constellation Strand (Relationships)

**Question:** How do relationships form, strain, and transform?

This is the emotional journey -- the heart of your story. It involves:
- Key relationships that anchor your protagonist
- How those relationships change under pressure
- What the protagonist learns about connection

**Write:**
- Starting relationships (who matters at the beginning?)
- Ending relationships (who matters at the end? How has it changed?)
- Five key relationship moments

### 2.4 Check the Weave

Every major story beat should involve at least two strands. At Forge Points, all three converge.

**Worksheet:** Fill out [02-three-strands-worksheet.md](worksheets/02-three-strands-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [02-three-strands-example.md](worksheets/examples/02-three-strands-example.md)

---

## Step 3: Dark Mirror (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Design an antagonist who reflects your protagonist's potential dark path.

### 3.1 The Parallel Origin

Your antagonist should share something significant with your protagonist:
- Same power, different choices
- Same background, different outcomes
- Same wound, different response

**Write:** What do protagonist and antagonist have in common?

### 3.2 The Divergence Point

At some point, the antagonist made a choice the protagonist will face. They chose wrong.

**Write:** What choice did the antagonist make? Why was it understandable?

### 3.3 The Kernel of Truth

Your antagonist needs a philosophy that is partially correct. If they're simply "evil," they're boring.

**Write:**
- What does your antagonist believe?
- Why is this belief partially valid?
- Why is it ultimately flawed?

### 3.4 The Offer (Beat 26)

At the story's crisis, your antagonist should offer the protagonist a tempting alternative. This offer must be genuinely appealing.

**Write:**
- What does the antagonist offer?
- Why is it tempting?
- What would the protagonist have to sacrifice to accept?

**Worksheet:** Fill out [05-dark-mirror-worksheet.md](worksheets/05-dark-mirror-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [05-dark-mirror-example.md](worksheets/examples/05-dark-mirror-example.md)

## Step 4: Character Constellation (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Profile the key characters who orbit your protagonist.

### 4.1 Essential Roles

Most Crucible stories need these characters:

| Role | Function | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **The Faithful** | Anchor who won't abandon protagonist | Samwise, Hermione |
| **The Mentor** | Guide who teaches, then dies | Gandalf, Dumbledore |
| **The Political Ally** | Resources without intimacy | Strategic partner |
| **The Dark Mirror** | Antagonist as shadow self | (from Step 3) |

You may combine roles (mentor + political ally) or split them (multiple faithful companions).

### 4.2 For Each Major Character, Define:

- **Name and Role**
- **Relationship to Protagonist** (how do they connect?)
- **Their Own Struggle** (what do they want/fear?)
- **Arc Summary** (how do they change across the story?)
- **Three Key Scenes** (where do they matter most?)

### 4.3 Draw the Constellation

Sketch how characters relate to each other, not just to the protagonist. Who else has relationships? Who conflicts?

```
            [Mentor]
               |
          (teaches)
               v
[Friend] <---> [Protagonist] ---> [Burden]
               |
          (mirrors)
               v
         [Antagonist]
```

**Worksheet:** Fill out [07-character-constellation-worksheet.md](worksheets/07-character-constellation-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [07-character-constellation-example.md](worksheets/examples/07-character-constellation-example.md)

---

## Step 5: Forge Points (40 minutes)

**Goal:** Plan the five crisis moments where everything changes.

### 5.1 Understanding Forge Points

Forge Points are moments where all three strands converge in crisis. Something must be sacrificed. There is no going back.

| Forge Point | Location | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| FP0: Ignition | ~10% | Destroys the ordinary world |
| FP1: First Crucible | ~30% | First impossible choice, partial failure |
| FP2: Second Crucible | ~55% | Hardening creates betrayal/loss |
| FP3: Third Crucible | ~75% | Mentor dies, protagonist must surrender pride |
| Apex | ~85% | Final surrender, all threads converge |

### 5.2 For Each Forge Point, Define:

**Quest Crisis:** What external threat forces action?

**Fire Crisis:** What internal struggle is triggered?

**Constellation Crisis:** What relationship stakes are on the line?

**What Is Sacrificed:** What is permanently lost?

**Consequence:** What changes because of this sacrifice?

### 5.3 The Escalation Test

Each Forge Point must raise stakes from the previous one. Check:
- Does FP1 hurt more than FP0?
- Does FP2 hurt more than FP1?
- Does FP3 hurt more than FP2?
- Does the Apex require the greatest sacrifice?

If any answer is "no," revise.

**Worksheet:** Fill out [03-forge-points-worksheet.md](worksheets/03-forge-points-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [03-forge-points-example.md](worksheets/examples/03-forge-points-example.md)

---

## Step 6: Mercy Ledger (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Plan four acts of compassion that pay off at the climax.

### 6.1 Understanding the Mercy Engine

The Mercy Engine tracks moments when your protagonist shows compassion despite cost. These mercies seem tactically foolish but prove strategically wise at Beat 31 (Unexpected Agents).

### 6.2 For Each Mercy, Define:

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Recipient** | Who receives this mercy? |
| **The Act** | What does the protagonist do? |
| **Immediate Cost** | What does it seem to cost? |
| **Later Payoff** | How does the recipient return the mercy? |
| **Beat 31 Connection** | How does this help at the climax? |

### 6.3 Distribute the Mercies

Place one mercy in each major section of your story:
- **Mercy 1:** Movement II (early, establishes pattern)
- **Mercy 2:** Movement II-III (deepens pattern)
- **Mercy 3:** Movement III (costs more as protagonist hardens)
- **Mercy 4:** Movement III-IV (most costly, closest to antagonist)

### 6.4 The Convergence

At Beat 31, all four mercy recipients should contribute to the climax. Together, they provide what the protagonist could not achieve alone.

**Worksheet:** Fill out [04-mercy-ledger-worksheet.md](worksheets/04-mercy-ledger-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [04-mercy-ledger-example.md](worksheets/examples/04-mercy-ledger-example.md)

---

## Step 7: Beat Planning (40 minutes)

**Goal:** Map all 36 beats to your chapters.

### 7.1 Choose Your Chapter Count

| Chapters | Beats per Chapter | Best For |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| 18 | 2 beats | Fast-paced, tight |
| 25 | ~1.5 beats | Balanced |
| 35 | ~1 beat | Expansive, detailed |

### 7.2 Map the Movements

| Movement | Beats | % of Story | If 25 Chapters |
|----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| I - Ignition | 1-6 | 10% | Ch 1-2 |
| II - First Tempering | 7-14 | 20% | Ch 3-7 |
| III - Scattering | 15-22 | 25% | Ch 8-13 |
| IV - Brightest Burning | 23-28 | 25% | Ch 14-19 |
| V - Final Forging | 29-34 | 15% | Ch 20-23 |
| Coda | 35-36 | 5% | Ch 24-25 |

### 7.3 Fill In Each Beat

For each of the 36 beats, note:
- Which strand(s) it emphasizes
- Which chapter it falls in
- Key events that occur
- Any notes for drafting

### 7.4 Cross-Reference Your Work

Check that your beat plan includes:
- [ ] All four Forge Points + Apex at correct positions
- [ ] All four mercies given before Beat 31
- [ ] All mercy payoffs at Beat 31
- [ ] Mentor death at FP3
- [ ] Dark Mirror's offer at Beat 26
- [ ] Friend's departure and return (if applicable)

**Worksheet:** Fill out [06-beat-planning-worksheet.md](worksheets/06-beat-planning-worksheet.md)

**Example:** See [06-beat-planning-example.md](worksheets/examples/06-beat-planning-example.md)

---

## After Planning: What's Next?

### Option A: Outline Each Chapter

Take your beat plan and expand each chapter into a scene-by-scene outline. For each scene, note:
- POV character
- Setting
- Scene goal (what changes?)
- Conflict
- Outcome

### Option B: Start Drafting

Some writers prefer to draft from the beat plan directly, discovering scenes as they write. The Crucible Structure provides enough scaffolding to prevent getting lost.

### Option C: Use the Crucible Plugin

If you're using the Crucible Suite plugin, your planning documents can be converted into project files that guide the drafting process with built-in continuity checking and review systems.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Vague Strands

**Problem:** "The Quest is about saving the kingdom."

**Fix:** Be specific. "The Quest is about protecting the twelve memory-keepers, escorting them across the Shattered Lands to the Sanctuary of Echoes before the winter solstice."

### Mistake 2: Antagonist Without Philosophy

**Problem:** "The villain wants to destroy everything because they're evil."

**Fix:** Give them a coherent worldview. Why do they believe their approach is right? What truth do they see that the protagonist misses?

### Mistake 3: Mercies Without Cost

**Problem:** "She spares the enemy soldier (no one notices or cares)."

**Fix:** Every mercy must cost something immediate -- political capital, strategic advantage, personal safety, ally trust.

### Mistake 4: Forge Points That Don't Escalate

**Problem:** FP2 is less devastating than FP1.

**Fix:** Each Forge Point must hurt more than the last. If FP2 isn't worse, raise its stakes or lower FP1's.

### Mistake 5: Strands That Don't Weave

**Problem:** Quest happens in chapters 1-5, Fire in 6-10, Constellation in 11-15.

**Fix:** Every major beat should involve at least two strands. Use the Strand Integration Check in your worksheets.

---

## You're Ready

You now have a complete structural blueprint for your novel. The Crucible Structure isn't a formula that writes itself -- it's scaffolding that supports your creativity while ensuring your story has:

- **Momentum** (the beats drive forward)
- **Depth** (three strands create richness)
- **Resonance** (theme emerges through contrast with the Dark Mirror)
- **Payoff** (the Mercy Engine rewards reader patience)

Trust the structure. Write your story.
