## Beat Flexibility Guidelines

The 36 beats provide structure, not a straitjacket. Consider these principles:

### Combining Beats
Adjacent beats with compatible functions can be combined into single scenes. Beats 2-3 (Dual Arrival + First Spark) often work as one sequence.

### Extending Beats
Complex narratives may expand certain beats across multiple chapters. Beat 29 (War of All Fronts) might span several scenes showing different battlefronts.

### Reordering Within Movements
Beats within a movement can shift order when dramatically necessary, but Forge Points should remain at movement boundaries.

### Subplot Beats
Secondary characters can have their own beat progressions running in parallel, typically at compressed scale.

### The Inviolable Sequence
While individual beats flex, the Movement progression is fixed:
- Ignition must precede Tempering
- Scattering must precede Brightest Burning
- Final Forging must follow all preparation
- Coda closes the narrative

The Forge Points (Beats 6, 11, 21, 28, 33) are structural pillars. Moving them fundamentally alters the architecture.
