# The Three Currencies

## Introduction to Resource Management in Story

Every story involves resource management, whether writers recognize it or not. Characters have limited time, energy, relationships, and capabilities. The Three Currencies system makes this explicit, transforming vague narrative tension into concrete, trackable choices.

In the Crucible structure, protagonists manage three interconnected resources: POWER, HUMANITY, and TIME. Each decision spends or gains these currencies in different combinations. The fundamental tension: you cannot optimize all three simultaneously. Something must give.

This creates meaningful choices. When a character can have everything, decisions become arbitrary. When every choice costs something valuable, decisions reveal character and generate authentic tension.

## The Currency Table

| Currency | Accumulated By | Spent On | Depleted By |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| POWER | Training, victories, acquiring resources | Quest advancement, protection, confrontation | Overreach, mercy, restraint |
| HUMANITY | Mercy, bonds, vulnerability, compassion | Resisting corruption, inspiring loyalty, maintaining relationships | Ruthlessness, isolation, expedience |
| TIME | Victories, alliances, efficiency | Everything | Failures, doing things right, thoroughness |

## POWER: The Currency of Capability

**How It Is Accumulated:**
Power grows through training, successful confrontations, acquiring resources, and building capabilities. Each victory adds to the protagonist's arsenal. Knowledge, skills, weapons, allies who serve rather than love---all contribute to power.

**How It Is Spent:**
Power is the currency of action. Confronting antagonists, protecting loved ones, advancing the quest, overcoming obstacles---all require power expenditure. Even displaying power to deter enemies costs some of the resource.

**How It Is Depleted:**
Power drains through overreach (attempting too much), showing mercy (choosing not to use available force), and exercising restraint (holding back when striking would be advantageous). Each act of compassion that limits effective action costs power.

## HUMANITY: The Currency of Connection

**How It Is Accumulated:**
Humanity grows through mercy shown to enemies, bonds formed with allies, and moments of vulnerability. Every time characters choose compassion over expedience, humanity increases. Allowing others to see weakness, admitting mistakes, and prioritizing relationships all build this currency.

**How It Is Spent:**
Humanity is spent on resisting corruption (staying true to values under pressure), inspiring genuine loyalty (not fear-based obedience), and maintaining authentic relationships. The internal strength to refuse tempting shortcuts comes from humanity reserves.

**How It Is Depleted:**
Ruthlessness drains humanity. Isolation erodes it. Choosing efficiency over ethics, sacrificing relationships for goals, and treating people as instruments all deplete this currency. Each compromise "for the greater good" costs humanity.

## TIME: The Currency of Thoroughness

**How It Is Accumulated:**
Time is gained through victories (successful outcomes that don't require repetition), alliances (others handling tasks), and efficiency (methods that work quickly). Winning decisively buys time. Delegating effectively buys time.

**How It Is Spent:**
Time is spent on everything. Every action, every decision, every moment of the quest consumes this universal currency. It is the one resource that always depletes, never holds steady.

**How It Is Depleted:**
Failures waste time (requiring repeated attempts). Doing things right takes time (thoroughness is slow). Careful planning costs time. Training costs time. Building relationships costs time. Everything worthwhile has a time cost.

## The Core Tension: Optimization Is Impossible

The Three Currencies create an insoluble optimization problem. You cannot maximize all three because:

- Gaining power often requires spending time (training) or humanity (ruthlessness)
- Gaining humanity often requires spending time (relationship-building) or power (showing mercy)
- Saving time often requires spending power (brute force) or humanity (cutting corners)

This impossibility is the engine of meaningful conflict. Characters must choose which currency matters most in each moment, and those choices define them.

## Currency Trade-Offs at Each Movement

Movement One typically establishes baseline currencies. Characters enter with some of each, though rarely in balance.

Movement Two forces currency decisions as pressure mounts. Early choices often favor time (urgency is felt) or power (threats must be met).

Movement Three brings the accumulated costs to bear. Currency debts come due. Characters low on humanity struggle to inspire allies. Characters low on power cannot confront obstacles. Characters out of time face consequences for every delay.

## Examples of Currency Decisions

**Using power ruthlessly:** A character kills enemy soldiers rather than incapacitating them. This gains time (faster resolution) but costs humanity (killing when alternatives existed).

**Showing mercy:** A character spares a defeated enemy. This costs time (enemy may return) and power (resource spent restraining rather than eliminating) but gains humanity (compassion demonstrated).

**Taking time to do things right:** A character spends weeks training rather than rushing into battle. This costs time but preserves power (better prepared) and potentially humanity (fewer desperate measures needed).

**Rushing ahead:** A character skips preparation to meet a deadline. This saves time but costs power (insufficient readiness) or humanity (corners cut, people neglected).

## Using Currencies to Create Meaningful Choices

When designing scenes, identify which currencies are at stake. Make the trade-offs explicit. Ensure readers understand what each choice costs and gains.

Strong currency moments occur when:
- Two currencies conflict (save time OR preserve humanity, not both)
- A depleted currency forces compromise (out of time, must sacrifice power or humanity)
- Past spending creates current crisis (earlier ruthlessness means no allies now)
- Characters with different currency priorities clash (one values power, another values humanity)

The Three Currencies transform abstract stakes into concrete resource management, making every decision weigh with accumulated consequence.
