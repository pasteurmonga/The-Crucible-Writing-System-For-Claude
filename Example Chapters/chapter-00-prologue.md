# Prologue: The Blood Remembers

---

*Spoken by the Keeper of the Long Memory, as recorded in the Archives of the Shattered Path:*

---

Once, we flew.

Not metaphor. Not legend. Not the comfortable lies we tell children to explain why the sky seems so far away. Once, the greatest among us spread wings of pure light and rose beyond the boundaries of the mortal realm. They ascended.

I have seen the places where they departed. Stone platforms worn smooth by the passage of transcendent feet. Gates that open onto nothing—because what they opened onto no longer exists for us. Gardens where the flowers still bloom in colors that hurt human eyes, fed by the residue of power that touched them once and changed them forever.

The evidence is everywhere, if you know how to look. The world remembers, even when we forget.

---

*The first ascension happened before recorded history.*

We know this because the oldest texts speak of it as already ancient. "In the time before the Counting," the sage Wan Xi wrote, "when the paths were young and the boundaries thin, a woman whose name was forgotten before it could be written walked to the edge of everything and kept walking."

She didn't die. The texts are clear on this. Death is a closing. What she did was an opening.

Others followed. Dozens. Hundreds. Over the generations, those who reached the peak of cultivation discovered they could go further—that the peak was not an ending but a doorway. They stepped through. They became something else. Something more.

And the world changed with them.

Each ascension strengthened what remained behind. Bloodlines deepened. Cultivation techniques refined themselves, as if the very paths were learning to guide others upward. The boundaries between realms grew more permeable, allowing power to flow more freely, making each subsequent ascension easier than the last.

It was a cycle. A wheel. A great turning that lifted everything higher with each revolution.

---

*Then the wheel stopped.*

The histories disagree on why. Some speak of a war—powers beyond mortal comprehension clashing in realms we cannot see, shattering the pathways behind them. Others whisper of a choice—that those who ascended chose to close the door, fearing what might follow them through. Still others believe it was simply entropy—that all paths eventually erode, all doors eventually warp in their frames, all wheels eventually lose their momentum.

What we know is this: one day, ascension was possible. The next, it was not.

The last to attempt it was a man named Shen. I have read his final journal. His words still burn:

*"I stand at the threshold. I can see it—the opening, the beyond, the everything that awaits. But when I step forward, I step into nothing. The door is there. The door is open. But something has removed the room it leads to."*

He tried for thirty years. The door remained. The way through did not.

He died at the threshold, reaching for something that no longer existed.

---

*That was four thousand years ago.*

Four thousand years of stagnation. Of closed doors. Of cultivation paths that led to peaks and stopped there, as if the mountains themselves had been truncated, their summits sawed off by an indifferent god.

Four thousand years of bloodlines diluting. Each generation weaker than the last. Each great family watching their children reach heights their grandparents would have considered merely adequate.

Four thousand years of the world drifting out of alignment. Of wrongness accumulating like sediment in a riverbed. Of something broken that refuses to heal.

The cultivators feel it. They train and strive and advance, and somewhere in their bones they know that this is not how it should be. That there was once more. That the ceiling pressing down on them is artificial—imposed from without, not grown from within.

The blood remembers what the mind has forgotten.

---

*I have studied the old texts. I have walked the abandoned threshold platforms. I have spoken with those so ancient they remember when ascension was still spoken of as possibility rather than myth.*

Something is wrong with the world.

Not wrong like an illness—wrong like a fracture. Like a bone that healed crooked and now aches with every step. Like a song with a note missing, a harmony that should resolve but doesn't.

The cultivators feel it as a ceiling. The mortals feel it as a vague unease, a sense that the sky is lower than it should be. The world itself feels it as imbalance, as tilt, as a slow drift toward something that waits in the dark.

I do not know what waits. The texts grow vague when they approach that subject, as if the authors themselves were afraid to name it. But I know it is patient. I know it has been growing stronger as the world grows weaker. I know that four thousand years of stagnation have fed it like water feeds a root system, spreading beneath the surface, preparing for something.

---

*But the blood remembers.*

In every culture, in every nation, in every hidden corner of the world, there are those who carry echoes of what was lost. Their bloodlines are thin—diluted by millennia without reinforcement—but they are not gone. They dream of flight. They wake with the taste of transcendence on their tongues and don't know why. They look at the sky and feel a longing so deep it has no name.

The old families know this. They hoard these bloodlines, breed them carefully, hope that somewhere in their children's children's children, the old power will resurface.

They are right to hope. But they are looking in the wrong places.

---

*The sages speak of cycles.*

Not literal wheels, but patterns. Rhythms that repeat across the ages. The drought always ends. The empire always falls. The door that closes eventually opens again.

Four thousand years is a long time for mortals. But for a cycle? For a pattern that spans the life of worlds?

Four thousand years might be a held breath. A pause between heartbeats. A moment of darkness before the dawn.

I cannot prove this. The future is not mine to see. But when I meditate on the old texts, when I sit at the abandoned thresholds and listen to the silence, I hear something beneath it. A hum. A vibration. The sound a door makes when it is about to move.

The wheel is turning again.

I can feel it.

---

*This is not prophecy. I am not a prophet. I am simply old, and tired, and have spent my life studying what was lost.*

But I will say this:

The past cannot be undone. The four thousand years of stagnation are carved into the world's bones. The blood has diluted. The paths have crumbled. The threshold platforms stand empty, monuments to something that no longer exists.

We cannot go back.

But perhaps—*perhaps*—we can go forward. Perhaps the old way is not the only way. Perhaps what was closed can be opened differently, by someone who never learned that it was supposed to be impossible.

The sages say that transcendence requires surrender. Not defeat—*surrender*. The willingness to release what you were in order to become what you might be.

Perhaps the world itself needs to surrender. To release its grip on the old ways—the broken ways—and find a new path to the same destination.

I will not live to see it. My time is ending; I can feel it in my bones. But I have preserved what I know. I have written it down for those who come after.

And when the wheel finally turns—when someone stands at the threshold again and finds a way through—I hope they understand:

The past cannot be undone.

It can only be transcended.
