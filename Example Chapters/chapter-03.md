# Chapter 3: The Impossible Choice

---

Sonny told himself he wouldn't go back.

He spent the morning on his usual routes, stealing breakfast from the market, checking his caches, avoiding the River Rats' territory. Normal. Safe. The rhythms of survival that had kept him alive for years.

But his feet kept drifting toward the plaza.

He'd catch himself walking in the wrong direction and correct course, only to find himself drifting again a few minutes later. It was like something had hooked into his chest and was pulling, gently but inexorably, toward the Selection grounds.

*Xu Sun saw me.*

The thought wouldn't let him rest. He'd replayed the moment a hundred times during the sleepless night: those black eyes finding him in the shadows, that slight nod. It had to mean something. It had to—

*Or it meant nothing. You're imagining things. You're building castles from smoke because you can't accept that you'll never be anything.*

Both voices fought for dominance as Sonny walked the streets of Xin Birch. The wanting and the warning. The hope and the fear.

By midday, the wanting had won.

---

The Selection grounds were different today.

The elaborate decorations remained, but the atmosphere had shifted. Yesterday had been anticipation; today was tension. The noble families clustered in tight groups, speaking in urgent whispers. Candidates who'd performed brilliantly now stood with hunched shoulders and uncertain eyes.

No one knew what the masters wanted.

Sonny found a new hiding spot—not the gap between the warehouses, which felt compromised now, but a rooftop overlooking the plaza from greater distance. Safer. Less visible.

He should have stayed there.

The masters emerged from wherever they'd spent the night, climbing the platform steps with the same unhurried grace as before. Wu had abandoned the drunk act; his movements were fluid, precise, every inch the Sword Saint his legends described. Mei's sadness seemed deeper today, more present. Xu was unchanged—a monument to stillness and contained power.

They didn't sit.

Instead, they stood at the edge of the platform, surveying the crowd. Waiting.

"We have made our decision," Wu announced. His voice carried across the plaza without effort. "But first, there is someone we wish to speak with."

The noble families surged forward, each hoping their candidate would be named. The air crackled with desperate anticipation.

Wu's gaze swept the crowd—and then lifted, moving past the gathered nobles, past the decorated plaza, toward the rooftops beyond.

Toward Sonny.

"You," Wu said. "The one who's been watching. Come down."

---

For one frozen moment, Sonny thought he could still run.

He was on a rooftop. The masters were in the plaza. If he moved now, fast and quiet, he could disappear into the maze of streets he knew better than anyone. They might be legends, but this was his territory. He could—

"Don't make us come get you," Wu added, and there was something beneath the light tone. Something that reminded Sonny of the killing intent that had frozen the plaza yesterday.

His legs moved without his permission.

He climbed down from the rooftop, hands shaking on the familiar handholds. Dropped into the alley below. Walked toward the plaza entrance, each step feeling like a march toward execution.

The crowd parted for him.

Not the way they'd parted for the masters—not with reverence or fear. They parted with confusion, with disgust, with the instinctive recoil of the privileged confronted with poverty.

Sonny felt their eyes on him. Felt them taking in his ragged clothes, his unwashed hair, the dirt ground into skin that hadn't seen a proper bath in months. He saw noses wrinkle. Saw lips curl.

*Street rat.*

He heard the whisper ripple through the crowd, growing louder with each repetition.

*Street rat. Street rat. What's a street rat doing here?*

The walk across the plaza was the longest of his life.

---

A hand caught his arm before he reached the platform.

The grip was iron—a cultivator's grip, unbreakable. Sonny looked up into the face of a young man in noble robes, features twisted with outrage.

"How dare you," the man hissed. His qi flared, hot against Sonny's skin. "How dare you pollute this sacred ground with your presence. Did you think you could hide here and steal from your betters?"

Sonny's mouth went dry. He knew this type. Had avoided this type his whole life. Nobles who saw street orphans as less than human, who would beat or kill without consequence because who would care?

"I—" he started.

"Chen Wei." The voice came from the platform—calm, measured, utterly devoid of inflection. Xu Sun hadn't moved, but somehow his attention had focused on the scene below like a blade finding its target. "Release him."

Chen Wei's face went pale. His grip loosened.

"Honored master, this creature was skulking on the rooftops. He's obviously a thief, or a spy, or—"

"Release. Him."

The second repetition carried something that made Sonny's bones vibrate. Chen Wei's hand flew open as if burned. He stumbled backward, terror replacing outrage.

Sonny stood alone in the center of the plaza, surrounded by hostile faces, with three ancient powers watching from above.

*This is it. This is how I die.*

"Come up," Mei said. Her voice was gentle—so gentle it hurt. "It's alright. We just want to talk to you."

Somehow, impossibly, he believed her.

---

The platform steps felt like they went on forever.

Sonny climbed them one at a time, acutely aware of every eye in the plaza fixed on his back. The whispers had become a constant drone: *street rat, thief, beggar, filth*. He could feel the hatred radiating from the noble families, their fury at having their sacred Selection interrupted by this... this *nothing*.

He reached the top.

The three masters stood in a loose semicircle, watching him with expressions he couldn't read. Wu's amusement. Mei's curiosity. Xu's absolute stillness.

Up close, their presence was overwhelming. The air itself felt thicker here, charged with power that made his skin prickle and his lungs labor. These were beings who had walked the earth for millennia, who had watched empires rise and fall, who could end his existence with a thought.

And they were looking at him.

*At* him. Not through him. Not past him.

For the first time in his life, Sonny was truly, completely visible.

"What's your name?" Wu asked.

The question was so ordinary, so human, that Sonny answered before he could think. "Sonny."

"Just Sonny? No family name?"

"I don't have a family."

Wu nodded as if this confirmed something. "Street orphan. How old?"

"I don't know. Sixteen, maybe. Seventeen."

"How long have you been surviving on your own?"

"As long as I can remember."

The questions continued—simple, direct, almost casual. Where did he sleep? How did he eat? Had he ever trained in cultivation? Did he know what his qi felt like?

Sonny answered honestly, too overwhelmed to lie. He told them about the rooftops and the caches and the careful dance of theft and invisibility. He told them he'd never trained, never even touched a cultivation technique. He told them his qi felt like nothing because he didn't know he had any.

Through it all, the nobles watched. And fumed.

---

"Honored masters." A voice rose from the crowd—one of the senior nobles, a patriarch with gray in his beard and outrage in his eyes. "Surely this jest has gone on long enough. The Selection is a sacred tradition. To waste it on interrogating a *street rat*—"

"A jest?" Wu turned to face the crowd, and his smile had edges now. "You think we traveled across the continent for a jest?"

"I think—" The patriarch hesitated, then pressed on. "I think the honored masters have perhaps been away from civilization too long. There are protocols. Standards. The candidates presented yesterday represent the finest young cultivators in the region. To ignore them in favor of this... this..."

"This what?" Mei asked softly.

The patriarch's face reddened. "This nothing. This nobody. Look at him—he's not even clean. He has no bloodline, no training, no family. He is *nothing*."

"Interesting." Xu spoke for the first time, and the word fell into silence like a stone into deep water. "You look at him and see nothing."

"What else is there to see?"

"That," Xu said, "is why you will never understand what we are doing here."

He turned to face his fellow masters. "I say we take him. All three of us. Together."

---

The plaza erupted.

Shouts of outrage overlapped with cries of disbelief. Noble parents demanded explanations. Candidates who'd trained their entire lives screamed about injustice. The careful dignity of the Selection shattered into chaos.

On the platform, the three masters ignored it all.

"Together?" Wu's eyebrows rose. "That's unprecedented. We've never shared a student."

"Perhaps it's time we did." Xu's gaze remained fixed on Sonny. "I felt it yesterday, when I looked into the shadows. Something in this boy. Something that responds to all three of our paths."

"I felt it too," Mei admitted. Her eyes were bright—brighter than Sonny had seen them. "When he climbed the steps, when he stood before us... there's something locked inside him. Something that's been waiting."

"Waiting for what?" Sonny heard himself ask.

The three masters exchanged a look—a whole conversation in a single glance. Then Wu laughed, and the sound cut through the crowd's fury like a blade.

"For us, apparently. Xu is right. I claim him. For the sword path."

"I claim him as well," Mei said. "For the alchemist's way."

"And I," Xu finished, "for the scholar's discipline."

Three claims. Three paths. Three legends, choosing a street orphan over thirty-one noble candidates.

The crowd's outrage reached a fever pitch. Someone was shouting about tradition. Someone else was threatening appeals to higher authorities. A woman—probably Chen Wei's mother—was actually crying.

Sonny stood at the center of it all, unable to move, unable to think, unable to do anything except stare at the three beings who had just upended the entire world.

"You're choosing me," he said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes," Xu said simply.

"But—I'm nothing. I'm no one. I can't—"

"You're not nothing." Mei stepped forward and, very gently, placed her hand on his chest. Her touch was cool, soothing, and beneath it Sonny felt something stir—something deep inside him that he'd never known was there. "You've never been nothing. You've just been waiting to be found."

"We found you," Wu said. "Now the question is: do you accept?"

---

The crowd had grown quiet, watching.

Sonny felt their hatred pressing against him from all sides. These noble families would never forgive this. Their children had been passed over for a street rat. Whatever happened next, he had made enemies today that would last a lifetime.

*If you accept, everything changes.*

The thought was terrifying. He'd spent his entire life invisible, safe in the shadows, surviving by not being seen. Accepting this meant stepping into the light. It meant becoming a target.

*But if you refuse...*

He looked at the three masters. At Wu's sharp amusement and Mei's gentle hope and Xu's unreadable patience. They were offering him everything he'd ever wanted—everything he'd told himself he could never have.

*They see you. They chose you. When has anyone ever chosen you?*

"Yes," he whispered.

Then, louder: "Yes. I accept."

Mei's smile was like sunrise. Wu laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. Even Xu's expression shifted—a microscopic softening that might have been approval.

"Then it's decided." Wu turned to face the crowd, raising his voice to carry across the plaza. "This boy—Sonny—will be our disciple. All three of us. The Selection is complete."

The silence that followed was absolute.

Then Chen Wei's voice cut through it, shaking with fury: "This is an outrage! A mockery! You would choose this—this *garbage* over the heirs of noble houses? Over candidates who have trained since childhood?"

"Yes," Xu said. "We would."

"The great sects will hear of this! The cultivation world will know how the three masters spat upon tradition and chose a—"

"Careful." Wu's voice had lost all humor. "You're speaking very loudly for someone who was already warned once today."

Chen Wei's mouth snapped shut. His face was purple with rage, but the memory of Xu's command—*release him*—was clearly still fresh.

Other voices rose to take his place. Protests, accusations, demands for explanation. The noble families were united in their outrage, centuries of rivalry forgotten in the face of this unprecedented insult.

The masters didn't respond. They simply stood, patient as mountains, waiting for the storm to exhaust itself.

Sonny watched it all from his place on the platform, and felt something strange building in his chest.

They hated him. All of them. Every noble face in that crowd was twisted with fury that would never fade. He had made more enemies in this single moment than most people made in a lifetime.

And he couldn't bring himself to care.

Because three legends had looked at him and seen something worth choosing. Three ancient powers had rejected the finest candidates in the region and claimed him instead.

*They chose me.*

The thought was a fire in his blood.

*They chose ME.*

---

He didn't remember climbing down from the platform.

He didn't remember the crowd parting around him—not with reverence, but with revulsion, as if his presence might contaminate them. He didn't remember reaching the edge of the plaza, or the alley beyond, or the familiar maze of streets that had been his whole world for so long.

He just ran.

His feet carried him without conscious direction, following routes worn into instinct by years of fleeing. Through the market district. Over the broken cart. Under old Peng's fence. Past the fishmonger's, past the bakery, past all the landmarks of his invisible existence.

He ran until his lungs burned and his legs gave out, and then he collapsed against a wall in some forgotten corner of Xin Birch and tried to remember how to breathe.

*What just happened?*

The question kept repeating, unanswerable. He'd walked into the plaza a street rat. He was walking out a disciple of three legends.

*What just happened?*

His hands were shaking. His whole body was shaking. He pressed his palms against the cold stone of the wall and tried to anchor himself to something real, something solid, something that made sense.

The wall didn't help.

Nothing made sense anymore.

---

Night found him on his favorite rooftop, the one with the view of the noble district.

The celebrations had started down there—lights and music and the sounds of revelry drifting up through the evening air. But not for him. Never for him. The nobles were celebrating their escape from the masters' strange choice, drinking to the certainty that this madness couldn't last.

*A street rat as disciple to three legends. It's absurd. It's impossible.*

*It's real.*

Sonny stared at his hands. The same hands that had stolen and scraped and fought for survival. The same hands that had never held a sword or drawn a bow or shaped an alchemical compound.

Tomorrow, everything would change.

The masters would come for him—Mei had said as much before he'd fled, her voice carrying after him like a promise. They would take him from these streets, from this city, from everything he'd ever known. They would try to make him into something he couldn't imagine being.

*What if I fail?*

The fear was cold in his stomach. What if the masters had made a mistake? What if the "something" they'd sensed in him turned out to be nothing? What if he disappointed them, and they cast him out, and he ended up back here with nothing but the memory of what might have been?

*What if I succeed?*

That fear was worse. Because success meant becoming someone else. It meant leaving behind the street rat who'd survived by being invisible, and becoming... what? A cultivator? A legend in training?

A person who mattered?

He didn't know if he was ready for that. He didn't know if he'd ever be ready.

But the choice had been made. By them. By him.

*Yes. I accept.*

Those words couldn't be taken back. Whatever came next, he'd already stepped through the door.

Sonny lay back on the cold rooftop and stared at the stars. The same stars he'd stared at a thousand times before, when he was just a street rat dreaming impossible dreams.

The dreams weren't impossible anymore.

He closed his eyes and waited for morning.
