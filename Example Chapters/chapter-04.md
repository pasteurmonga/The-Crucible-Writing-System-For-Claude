# Chapter 4: Leaving the Streets

---

The crate still smelled like rotting cabbages.

Sonny had wedged himself into his spot behind the fishmonger's stall, shoulders pressed against splintering wood, knees drawn up to make himself smaller. The same position he'd held through a hundred cold nights. A thousand. He'd lost count years ago.

The difference was that tonight, for the first time, he noticed the smell.

He'd never noticed it before. The crate was shelter. It was safety, or the closest thing to it that existed on the streets of Xin Birch. You didn't critique the smell of your own survival. But now the rot crawled into his nostrils and lodged there, and he couldn't stop thinking about it.

*This is what I've been sleeping in.*

The thought felt foreign. Like it belonged to someone else—someone who had other options, who could afford to be disgusted by the circumstances of their existence.

He didn't have other options. He *was* his circumstances.

Wasn't he?

---

The moon hung fat and yellow over Xin Birch, painting the cramped streets in colors that made everything look drowned. Sonny stared at his hands. Callused. Scarred across the knuckles from fights he barely remembered. The nail of his left index finger had never grown back right after he'd caught it in a closing door when he was—what, eight? Nine? The street orphans didn't track birthdays.

These hands had stolen. Had fought. Had scraped and clawed and done whatever was necessary.

*Three legends chose me.*

The thought kept intruding, no matter how many times he tried to push it away. It was absurd. It was obviously some kind of trick, some elaborate cruelty designed to give him hope before crushing it. That was how the world worked. That was how it had always worked.

Except.

Except he'd watched the Selection. He'd seen the noble candidates—their fine robes, their carefully cultivated qi signatures, their confidence born from a lifetime of knowing they mattered. And he'd seen the three masters reject them. Publicly. Devastatingly.

He'd seen Wu Liao's killing intent leak through the fool's mask for one heartbeat, silencing a foreign sect member who'd dared show disrespect. He'd seen Mei Luo's beauty and her sadness, the way her presence pulled at something in his chest he didn't have words for. He'd seen Xu Sun walk through the crowd like a blade through silk, silence spreading in his wake.

These were not people who played jokes on street orphans.

So what were they doing?

---

*You should run.*

The voice in his head was familiar. It was the voice that had kept him alive for sixteen years—or however old he actually was. The voice of survival, of knowing when to fight and when to flee and when to simply not be seen.

*This is a trap. Has to be. Nothing good comes for free. Nothing good comes at all.*

He believed it. He'd built his entire existence on believing it.

But another voice was speaking now, quieter, buried so deep he'd almost forgotten it existed.

*What if it isn't?*

He remembered being small—younger than he could clearly recall—watching a cultivator fly overhead. Actually fly, robes streaming, the qi around them visible as a shimmer against the dusk. He'd stood there with his mouth hanging open until an older street kid cuffed him and told him to stop drawing attention.

He'd learned not to watch after that. Looking at cultivators too long was dangerous. They didn't like being stared at by rats. They didn't like being reminded that the rats existed at all.

But he'd never stopped *wanting* to watch.

*What if this is real?*

---

The night stretched on. Sonny didn't sleep.

He catalogued everything he would be leaving behind. It didn't take long.

The crate. The spot by the baker's back door where sometimes—not often, but sometimes—someone would leave bread that was only a day stale. The particular shade of a certain alley he could disappear into when the merchant guards came looking. The merchant guards themselves, who'd learned to hate him specifically, personally, who'd promised they'd break his legs if they ever caught him again.

The other street kids. But they weren't friends. They couldn't afford to be. Friendship on the streets meant sharing your food, and sharing your food meant dying faster. They had names he'd learned and carefully forgotten, faces that blurred together because getting attached only made it hurt more when the winter took them.

*There's nothing here.*

The realization should have been freeing. He could leave without looking back. No anchors. No chains.

Instead, it hollowed him out.

He had spent sixteen years in this city and the sum total of his existence could be erased overnight. No one would miss him. No one would remember. He would become one more cautionary tale the surviving street rats told each other—*remember that kid who thought he was special? Remember how they found him in a ditch?*

Except they probably wouldn't even tell that story. They'd just... not think about him at all.

*Is that better?* he wondered. *Being forgotten entirely, or being remembered as a warning?*

Neither. The answer was neither.

---

He must have dozed, because when he opened his eyes the moon had shifted and the cold had crept deeper into his bones. Something had changed in the air—a pressure, a weight, the particular stillness that preceded storms.

Or cultivators.

Sonny's survival instincts screamed at him to shrink smaller, to press himself into the shadows until he became one of them. But his body wouldn't obey. His eyes were searching the darkness, looking for—

There.

At the edge of the fishmonger's square, barely visible in the pre-dawn gloom, a figure sat on an upturned bucket. Casual. Relaxed. As if they had all the time in the world.

It was the fool.

Wu wasn't looking at him. He was looking up at the fading stars, his expression impossible to read at this distance. He might have been there for hours. He might have just arrived. Sonny couldn't tell.

*He found me.*

The thought sent ice through his veins. Three masters. Ancient powers. And they knew where he slept.

*Of course they do. They're legends. You're a rat in a crate. What did you think would happen?*

He should run. Right now. Before the trap closed. Before—

Wu turned his head, and even across the square, even in the uncertain light, Sonny felt it when their eyes met.

The master smiled.

And then he went back to watching the stars.

---

He didn't come closer. Didn't call out. Didn't do anything that a predator cornering prey would do. He just... sat there.

Sonny stayed frozen in his crate, barely breathing, waiting for the other shoe to drop. The minutes stretched. His legs started to cramp. The smell of rotting cabbage became unbearable.

Still Wu didn't move.

*What is he doing?*

Waiting, apparently. Just waiting.

*For what?*

The answer came to him slowly, reluctantly, like dawn creeping over a city that didn't want to wake up.

*For me to choose.*

---

The sun rose.

Sonny watched it happen through the crack in his crate, watched the yellow moonlight give way to pink and then gold and then the harsh flat white of another day in Xin Birch. Merchants began to stir. The fishmonger would arrive soon, would notice the strange man sitting in his square, would—

Wu rose from his bucket in one fluid motion, brushed off his robes, and walked away. Didn't look back. Didn't leave any kind of message. He simply left.

For a long moment, Sonny didn't understand.

Then he did.

*He's not going to make me.*

They'd chosen him. Three legends had looked at all the noble candidates with their power and their training and their lifetimes of privilege, and they'd said *no*, and they'd chosen a street rat who smelled like rotten cabbage.

And they weren't going to *force* him to accept it.

The choice was his.

---

He crawled out of the crate as the city woke around him. The fishmonger gave him a dirty look—*still here, rat?*—but didn't try to chase him off. Not worth the effort. Sonny was already fading into the background, becoming invisible, the way he always did.

But something was different now.

He walked through the streets of Xin Birch, really looking at them for the first time. The cramped buildings. The garbage in the gutters. The faces of the merchants, pinched with the daily grind of survival that was better than his survival but still survival, still the same basic fight to exist for one more day.

He walked past the baker's back door and didn't stop.

He walked past his favorite alley and didn't disappear into it.

He walked toward the gates of Xin Birch, where the road out of the city began—the road he'd never taken, because where would a street orphan go? There was nothing for him outside these walls. At least here he knew the dangers.

The gates loomed ahead. Massive wooden doors reinforced with iron, standing open because this was a trading city and trade required traffic. Guards lounged nearby, bored, barely glancing at the farmers and merchants passing through.

They wouldn't glance at Sonny either. He was invisible.

But at the edge of the road, just past the gates, three figures waited.

---

His feet stopped.

He was close enough now to see them clearly. Mei, her beauty somehow more devastating in the morning light, her sadness more visible. Xu, dark as onyx, still as stone, his presence commanding even when he did nothing but stand. And Wu, back in his fool's guise, picking at something between his teeth with apparent fascination.

They'd been waiting here.

They'd known he would come.

Sonny's chest constricted. His hands trembled. Every survival instinct he had was screaming at him to turn around, to run, to choose the devil he knew over the one he didn't.

*Three legends.*

*Waiting for a street rat.*

*Why?*

He forced himself to take a step. Then another. The distance between him and the gates seemed to stretch, each stride taking him further from everything he'd ever known and closer to something he couldn't even imagine.

The guards didn't stop him. Didn't even look at him.

He was invisible.

He passed through the gates.

---

The road outside Xin Birch was packed dirt, worn smooth by countless feet and wheels. Sonny had never walked on it before. The sensation was strange—the ground harder than the city's paving stones, somehow, more real.

He stopped a few paces from the three masters, suddenly aware of everything about himself. His smell. His ragged clothes. The dirt ground into his skin so deep it might never come out. He was filthy and scrawny and young and afraid, and they were—

"You took your time," Wu said. His voice was light, amused, the same tone he'd used during the Selection. The fool's voice. "I was starting to think I'd have to carry you out. Do you know how undignified that would have been? Ancient legend dragging a street orphan over his shoulder like a sack of millet?"

Sonny's mouth opened. Nothing came out.

Mei smiled, and it transformed her face from beautiful to breathtaking. "Don't mind Wu. He's been making jokes for three thousand years. Most of them are terrible."

"They're *refined*," Wu protested. "Aged, like fine wine. You simply lack the palate to appreciate them."

"I have tasted fine wine," Xu said. His voice was low, rough, like stones grinding together. "Your jokes are not comparable."

They were... bickering. Three living legends, ancient powers who had walked the cultivation path for millennia, who had watched empires rise and fall, who had—

They were bickering like children.

Something cracked in Sonny's chest. Some tension he'd been holding so tightly he'd forgotten it existed.

Wu noticed. His eyes sharpened for just a moment, the fool's mask slipping to reveal something else underneath—something that saw far too much.

"There it is," he said softly. Then, louder: "So. You walked out. Through the gates you've never crossed, away from the only life you've ever known. Pretty bold, for a rat."

Sonny found his voice. It came out hoarse. "You were waiting."

"Of course we were waiting. We told you we'd chosen you, didn't we? What kind of masters would we be if we just wandered off and expected you to find us?"

"I—" Sonny stopped. Started again. "I don't understand. Why me? There were—the nobles, they'd trained their whole lives, they had—"

"They had nothing we wanted," Xu cut in. The words were flat, final, a door closing on further questions about noble candidates. His dark eyes met Sonny's, and Sonny felt the weight of that gaze like a physical force. "We chose you."

"*Why?*"

The question hung in the morning air. The sun was fully up now, warming the road, burning off the last of the night's chill. In the city behind him, Sonny could hear the sounds of commerce, of life continuing exactly as it always had, as if nothing had changed.

But everything had changed.

Mei took a step forward. Her presence wrapped around him like perfume—not overwhelming, but impossible to ignore. Up close, he could see lines around her eyes that hadn't been visible before. Marks of age on a face that shouldn't age. A sadness so deep it had carved itself into her features.

"Because we see you," she said. "Not what you could become, not what we want you to be. You. Who you are right now. That's why."

---

Sonny didn't know what his face did, but Mei's expression softened.

"No one has ever told you that before," she said. It wasn't a question. "No one has ever looked at you and seen someone worth looking at."

He couldn't speak. His throat had closed up entirely. Because she was right—of course she was right—no one had ever—

"It's terrifying, isn't it?" Wu's voice was different now. Gentler. The fool's mask completely gone. "Being seen. When you've spent your whole life making yourself invisible, being seen feels like being flayed. All those walls you built. All those parts of yourself you buried. And here we are, digging them up."

Sonny's vision blurred. He blinked hard, refusing to—he would not cry in front of three ancient legends, he *would not*—

"Cry if you need to," Xu said gruffly. "We've all cried. Crying isn't weakness. Pretending you don't need to is."

Something broke.

Sonny didn't sob—he wasn't capable of that, had beaten it out of himself years ago—but tears ran down his face in silence. Hot and bitter and somehow cleansing, like poison being drawn from a wound.

He stood on a road he'd never walked, having passed through gates he'd never crossed, crying in front of three people who had seen him—actually *seen* him—for the first time in his life.

And they waited.

They didn't rush him. Didn't look away in embarrassment. Didn't offer meaningless comfort. They simply stood with him, bearing witness, letting him feel something he'd never been allowed to feel before.

He existed.

He mattered.

To someone.

---

When the tears finally stopped, Sonny felt empty. Not hollow, like before—empty the way a cup is empty, ready to be filled.

Wu handed him something. A cloth. Clean. Where had he even gotten that?

"The snot's a bit much," the master said, straight-faced. "Tears, very poetic. Snot, less so."

A sound escaped Sonny's throat. It took him a moment to realize it was a laugh.

Wu's eyes crinkled. "There it is. The first one's always the hardest. Gets easier from here."

"Does it?"

"No," Wu admitted. "I lied. It gets harder. Much harder. But you'll be able to laugh at it anyway, and that's what matters."

Sonny wiped his face with the cloth. His hands were shaking, but the trembling was different now. Not fear. Something else.

"Where—" He had to clear his throat. "Where are we going?"

"The Sanctuary," Mei said. "Our home. Your home now, if you want it."

"If I want it?"

"The choice remains yours. Every day, it remains yours. You can leave whenever you wish. We won't stop you. We won't hunt you down." She smiled again, and this time there was something fierce in it. "But I don't think you'll leave."

"No," Xu agreed. "Not this one. This one has fire in him. You can see it, if you look."

They could see it.

They could see *him*.

---

They began to walk.

Sonny fell into step beside them—not behind, which surprised him. He'd expected to trail after them like the street rat he was. But Wu kept slowing down to walk next to him, and whenever he tried to drift back, Mei was there, gently steering him forward.

They walked as equals.

It felt wrong. It felt impossible. It felt like wearing clothes that didn't fit, except somehow they did fit, he just wasn't used to things fitting.

"You'll stay with us for five years," Xu said as they walked. The road stretched ahead, winding into hills that Sonny had only ever seen from the city walls. "After that, you'll be ready to leave the Sanctuary and begin your path in the wider world. But first—the foundation. The basics. Everything you should have learned as a child, if you'd had a different life."

"Five years," Sonny repeated. It seemed impossible. An eternity. He'd never planned more than a day ahead in his entire existence.

"It will feel shorter than you think," Mei said. "It always does."

They walked in silence for a while. The city fell away behind them. Sonny kept expecting to feel something—loss, maybe, or regret. But there was nothing. Just the road beneath his feet and the morning sun on his face and three ancient beings walking beside him like he belonged there.

Like he'd always been meant to be here.

---

It was past noon when Wu spoke again.

"There's something you should know," he said. His tone was casual, but Sonny had begun to recognize that Wu's casual voice meant something important was coming. "About why we really chose you."

Sonny tensed. Here it was. The catch. The trap.

"We don't know why," Wu continued cheerfully. "Isn't that wonderful? Three masters, thousands of years of combined experience, and we looked at you and we *knew* and we couldn't explain it if you put a sword to our throats."

"What?"

"There's something in you." Mei's voice was thoughtful. "Something we recognized. We've argued about what it is. We haven't agreed. We may never agree."

"But we all felt it," Xu finished. "The moment we saw you in the shadows, watching us like you had any right to be there. Something said: *this one.*"

Sonny's mind raced. "Something like... destiny? Fate?"

Wu snorted. "Don't be dramatic. Fate is for stories. This was more like..." He paused, searching for words. "You know when you're starving, and you smell food, and your body says *eat* before your mind catches up? It was like that. Instinct. Deep knowing. Nothing mystical, just three old monsters recognizing something their bodies understood before their minds did."

"Speak for yourself," Mei murmured. "Some of us *are* mystical."

"Some of us are *pretentious*, you mean."

They were bickering again. Sonny found himself relaxing despite everything. Bickering, he understood. Bickering was human. These ancient legends, these terrifying powers—they bickered like merchants in a market.

Maybe that was the point.

Maybe they wanted him to understand that they were still, in some essential way, just people.

---

The afternoon wore on. They stopped occasionally—to rest, to drink from a stream, to eat provisions that Wu produced from somewhere with theatrical flourishes. Sonny hadn't eaten food this good in... ever, actually. He hadn't eaten food this good ever.

"Pace yourself," Mei warned gently as he reached for a third portion. "Your body isn't used to this. Too much too fast will make you sick."

"Speaking from experience," Wu added. "You should have seen him the first time we gave him anything better than garbage. Three days of— actually, no, I'll spare you the details. Suffice to say, pace yourself."

Sonny set down the food. His stomach was already aching, but it was a good ache. A fullness he'd never experienced.

"Why do you care?" The question came out before he could stop it. "If I get sick. If I eat too much. Why do you care about any of it?"

The three masters exchanged a look. Something passed between them—a whole conversation in a single glance. Then Xu spoke, and his voice was rougher than usual.

"Because you're ours now. Whether you understand that yet or not. Whether you believe it. You belong to us, and we take care of what belongs to us."

"Not *belong* in the sense of property," Mei added quickly. "Belong in the sense of connection. Family, though that word means little to you. We've chosen you, Sonny. That means something to us. It means everything."

"It means we'll die for you," Wu said. His voice was still light, still casual, but his eyes were ancient and serious. "If it comes to that. And it might. The path ahead of you... it's not safe. Nothing about this is safe. But you won't face it alone."

Sonny stared at them. Three strangers—no, not strangers anymore—looking at him like he was something precious. Something worth protecting.

He didn't know what to do with that.

He'd never had to know.

---

Evening fell.

They made camp beside the road, in a hollow that seemed too perfectly sheltered to be natural. Wu started a fire with a gesture that Sonny's eyes couldn't quite track. Mei spread bedrolls that appeared from nowhere. Xu simply sat, still as stone, watching the stars emerge one by one.

"Sleep," Mei told Sonny. "Tomorrow we reach the Sanctuary. Tonight, you rest."

"I don't—" He stopped. He'd been about to say he didn't sleep much, didn't need much, had trained himself to survive on fragments of rest snatched between dangers.

But he was tired.

He was so, so tired.

Not just physically—though his legs ached from the walking and his stomach was still processing the unfamiliar food. He was tired in his bones, in his soul, in all the places he'd kept locked up tight for years just to keep moving.

"That's what I thought," Mei said. "Go on. We'll keep watch."

Sonny lowered himself onto the bedroll. It was softer than anything he'd ever slept on. The fire crackled nearby, warm and safe. The three masters formed a loose triangle around him, their presence a barrier against the dark.

He should have been afraid. He was in the wilderness with three ancient powers who could kill him with a thought. He was further from everything he knew than he'd ever been. He was utterly, completely vulnerable.

He fell asleep faster than he had in years.

---

He dreamed of shadows.

Not nightmares—not exactly. Just shadows, stretching across a vast plain, connected to bodies he couldn't quite see. His own shadow among them, the shape of a street rat, the outline of everything he'd ever been.

In the dream, he reached down to touch his shadow. To pick it up. To carry it with him.

But you can't carry shadows. They're attached. They follow.

When he woke, the dream faded, but the feeling remained—a sense that he'd understood something important and immediately forgotten it.

---

Morning.

Wu was cooking something over the rekindled fire. The smell was extraordinary.

"Rise and shine, street rat," the master called. "Big day. Lots of walking. Many tedious explanations about the nature of cultivation. I hope you enjoy lectures, because Xu *loves* giving them."

"I do not love—" Xu began.

"He loves them," Wu said confidently. "Secretly. Deep down where he hides his softer feelings, like a squirrel hiding nuts for winter."

Mei laughed. The sound was startling—bright and genuine and completely unexpected from someone who carried such visible sorrow.

"I missed this," she said. "Having a student. It's been too long."

Sonny sat up, wincing at muscles that protested the movement. "How long?"

The question hung in the air. The three masters went quiet.

"Long enough," Wu said finally. "Long enough that we'd almost forgotten what it was like. Long enough that when we saw you, it felt like... hope. Does that answer your question?"

It didn't, not really. But Sonny nodded anyway.

Some things, he was beginning to understand, took time to learn. And for the first time in his life, he had time.

---

They broke camp and began the final leg of the journey. The road climbed into the hills, winding through forest that grew thicker and older with each mile. Sonny could feel something changing in the air—a heaviness, a presence, like the world itself was holding its breath.

"The Sanctuary is ahead," Mei said. "You'll feel it before you see it. The qi density there is... substantial."

"Substantial," Wu snorted. "That's one word for it. Overwhelmingly intense is another. Possibly fatal for the unprepared is a third."

Sonny swallowed. "Fatal?"

"Not for you." Xu's voice brooked no argument. "We've prepared. You'll struggle, but you won't die. The struggling is the point."

"Very reassuring," Wu drawled. "See, this is why I handle the new recruits. Xu's version of encouragement is 'you probably won't die.' Really inspires confidence."

"Confidence must be earned," Xu said. "False encouragement is cruelty."

They argued about this for the next hour.

Sonny listened, learning. Learning how they spoke to each other, how they disagreed without genuinely conflicting. Three beings who had known each other for millennia, who had probably had this exact argument a thousand times, who kept having it because the bickering itself was a kind of love.

He didn't understand that yet. Not really.

But he was beginning to.

---

The Sanctuary revealed itself gradually. First, a change in the air—the heaviness intensifying until Sonny felt like he was breathing something thicker than air. Then the trees fell away, and—

He stopped.

He couldn't help it.

The valley below was impossible. That was the only word for it. Mountains rose on all sides, but within their embrace was a garden of such perfect beauty that it hurt to look at. Buildings that seemed grown rather than built. A lake that reflected a sky somehow bluer than the one overhead. And everywhere, *everywhere*, the shimmer of qi so dense it was visible.

"Home," Mei said softly. "Your home now, if you want it."

Sonny's chest ached. He thought about his crate behind the fishmonger's stall. The smell of rotting cabbage. The guards who wanted to break his legs. The city that had never seen him, never would have seen him, would have let him die without noticing.

He thought about the gates he'd walked through. The road he'd traveled. The three ancient beings who had waited for him, had chosen him, had seen him when no one else ever had.

"Yes," he said. His voice cracked. He didn't care. "Yes. I want it."

Wu smiled—not the fool's smile, not the mask, but something real and warm and impossibly ancient.

"Then welcome home," he said. "Let's see what you become."

---

They descended into the valley together.

Sonny took one step, then another, then another. Behind him, the road stretched back toward Xin Birch, toward the life he'd left, toward the shadow of who he'd been.

He didn't look back.
