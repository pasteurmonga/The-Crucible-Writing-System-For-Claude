# Prelude: Three Reasons

---

## I. The Sword Master's Silence

The joke died in Wu Liao's throat.

He stood alone on the training ground, sword drawn, facing nothing. The morning mist curled around his feet like something trying to hold him in place. He'd been about to say something clever—some quip about the fog being too slow to spar with—but the words had simply... stopped.

For three thousand years, Wu had laughed. Through wars that painted continents red. Through the collapse of the Ascension Paths. Through watching students rise and fall and burn out, one after another, until he'd stopped counting. He'd laughed because the alternative was shattering, and he'd made a choice long ago about which he preferred.

But lately the laughter felt like ash in his mouth.

He sheathed his sword and sat on the cold stone, letting the mist soak through his robes. A younger version of himself would have made a joke about that too—something about the weather's poor hospitality, or his robes' wounded dignity. The joke formed automatically, the way his hand found his sword hilt, the way his feet found fighting stances.

Reflex. Not joy. Not anymore.

*When did I stop meaning it?*

The question had been circling for decades. Maybe centuries. Time blurred when you'd lived as long as Wu had. But somewhere in the long march of years, his laughter had hollowed out. The smile remained—convincing enough to fool anyone who didn't know him—but behind it was only mechanism. A defense that had forgotten what it was defending.

He thought about his last student. The one before the long silence.

Talented. Fierce. Absolutely humorless.

Wu had tried to teach her joy the way he'd been taught—through absurdity, through refusing to let darkness have the final word. But she'd looked at him with those serious eyes and asked: *How can you laugh when everything is so broken?*

He'd had no answer. Not a real one.

She'd died three years later. Not from enemies or corruption or any of the dramatic ends that claimed cultivators. She'd simply... stopped. Sat down one day and didn't get up again. The healers said her spirit had guttered out like a candle in a closed room.

She'd never learned to laugh. And Wu had never learned how to teach someone who couldn't hear the joke.

The mist was lifting now. Sunlight broke through, warming his face, and Wu felt something stir in his chest. Not joy—not yet—but the memory of joy. The ghost of what he'd once felt when mornings were new and the world was full of possibilities.

*Maybe that's enough,* he thought. *Maybe I don't need to feel it myself. Maybe I just need to find someone who still can.*

He rose, brushed off his robes, and walked toward the Sanctuary's main hall. Mei and Xu would be there. They'd been talking about the Selection for months—the gathering of noble candidates, the tired ritual they'd performed so many times before.

But this time, Wu had a different idea.

This time, he wasn't going to look for talent. He wasn't going to look for bloodlines or technique or any of the usual markers.

He was going to look for someone who could still laugh.

## II. The Bow Master's Arrow

Xu Sun had not drawn his bow in forty-seven years.

It hung on his wall, perfect and waiting, the string still humming with potential energy that would last another millennium. The finest weapon he'd ever crafted. The culmination of everything he knew about precision, patience, and the power of restraint.

He couldn't remember why he'd stopped using it.

That was a lie. He remembered exactly.

Xu sat in his study, surrounded by texts he'd read so many times the words had become meaningless. Treatises on cultivation theory. Histories of the great archers. Technical manuals for techniques that existed nowhere else in the world, preserved only in his memory and these pages.

All of it useless without someone to teach.

*You're waiting for the perfect student,* Mei had told him once. *You'll wait forever.*

He'd dismissed her words as typical alchemist mysticism. Mei saw transformation everywhere, insisted that imperfect things could become perfect through the right process. Xu had always believed differently. The bow taught that precision was everything. You drew. You aimed. You released. If any element was flawed, the arrow flew wrong. There was no room for approximation.

But forty-seven years was a long time.

Long enough to realize that his precision had calcified into paralysis. Long enough to see that a bow never drawn was just a decoration. Long enough to understand that waiting for perfection was just another word for fear.

He rose and walked to the wall where his bow hung. Ran his fingers along the curve of wood and bone. The weapon practically sang under his touch, eager to be used.

*The discipline of restraint,* he'd taught countless students. *Power unused is power preserved.*

But there was a difference between restraint and avoidance. Between patience and cowardice.

Xu had been a coward for forty-seven years.

His last student had been brilliant. Quick mind, steady hands, natural affinity for the bow. Xu had pushed her harder than any student before, demanded more, accepted nothing less than excellence. She'd risen to every challenge. Exceeded every expectation.

And then she'd left.

Not failed. Not burned out. Simply walked away. Said she couldn't breathe under his standards. Said his discipline had become a cage instead of a path. Said she'd rather be imperfect and free than excellent and suffocating.

He'd told himself she was weak. Undisciplined. Proof that modern cultivators lacked the rigor of previous generations.

He'd been lying.

She'd been right. His teaching had become a closed room, airless and dark. He'd forgotten that discipline was supposed to serve growth, not prevent it. That restraint was meaningless without eventual release.

Xu lifted the bow from its hooks. The weight was familiar, comforting, like meeting an old friend. He nocked an imaginary arrow, drew the string back, felt the tension build in his shoulders and arms.

He held the position. Breathed. Waited.

And then—for the first time in forty-seven years—he released.

The string sang. The empty air parted as if an arrow had flown. And something inside Xu that had been wound too tight for too long finally began to uncoil.

*I don't need a perfect student,* he thought. *I need a student I can perfect myself through teaching.*

When Mei and Wu spoke about the Selection, about finding someone worth training, Xu didn't argue. Didn't demand they wait for better candidates. Didn't list his requirements and criteria and impossible standards.

He simply said: *I'm ready.*

## III. The Alchemist's Grief

Mei Luo knelt in her garden and spoke to the dead.

"I still can't do it," she said quietly. "All these years, and I still can't transform this."

The grave marker didn't answer. It never did. But Mei kept talking anyway, the way she had every morning for the past eight centuries.

Her daughter's name was carved into the stone, along with the dates of a life that had lasted barely three decades. A blink. A breath. Nothing, in the span of Mei's existence—and everything.

The garden grew around the marker, fed by Mei's cultivation and her grief in equal measure. Flowers that existed nowhere else, bred through alchemical processes that took centuries to perfect. Colors that had no names in any human language. Beauty that hurt to look at.

*Everything can be transformed,* Mei taught her students. *Nothing is fixed. All things change.*

But some things refused to change. Some weights refused to lift. Some wounds stayed open no matter how many healing compounds you poured into them.

Her daughter had wanted to ascend.

That was the cruelest part. Not that she'd died—death came for everyone eventually, even legends—but that she'd died *reaching*. Trying to walk a path that had been closed for millennia. Believing, despite everything Mei told her, that she could be the one to reopen it.

She'd burned out. The power had been too much, the path too broken, the gap between aspiration and reality too vast. Mei had held her as the light faded from her eyes, had felt her spirit dissolve into nothing, had screamed until her throat bled and then screamed some more.

Eight hundred years, and the scream still echoed inside her.

Mei rose from the grave and walked through her garden, touching leaves and petals, feeling the life she'd cultivated from death. The irony wasn't lost on her. She'd spent centuries mastering transformation, could turn poison to medicine and medicine to poison, could reshape matter and energy and even the boundaries of possibility itself.

But she couldn't bring back her daughter. Couldn't transform her grief into peace. Couldn't change the fundamental truth that some losses were permanent.

*Or are they?*

The thought came unbidden, unwelcome, dangerous.

She'd sworn off teaching after her daughter died. What was the point? Every student was a reminder of what she'd lost. Every bright young face was a ghost of the face she'd never see again. And the risk—gods, the risk—that another one would reach too far, burn too bright, leave her with another grave to tend...

But Mei was old enough to recognize when her grief had become its own kind of prison.

*Everything can be transformed,* she'd taught. Had she stopped believing it? Had she let her loss calcify into permanence, the very thing she'd always argued against?

Her daughter had died reaching for something impossible. And Mei had responded by making herself impossible to reach. Closing off. Withdrawing. Letting her sorrow become the whole of her existence.

That wasn't transformation. That was surrender.

She walked back to the grave marker and knelt again, but this time her words were different.

"I'm going to try again," she said. "I'm going to teach. I don't know if I can survive losing another one, but I know I can't survive staying frozen like this. You would tell me I'm being ridiculous. You would say grief isn't supposed to last eight hundred years." She smiled, and it hurt, and she didn't look away from the pain. "You'd be right."

The stone said nothing. But the flowers around it seemed to lean toward her, just slightly, as if something unseen was listening.

When she joined Wu and Xu to discuss the Selection, they both noticed the change in her. The sadness was still there—it would always be there—but something else lived alongside it now. Something that looked almost like hope.

"I want to find someone," she told them. "Someone who needs to transform. Someone carrying something they think can't be changed."

Wu raised an eyebrow. "That's everyone, Mei."

"No." She shook her head. "Most people don't know they're carrying anything. I want to find someone who knows. Who feels the weight every day. Who thinks they're defined by it."

Xu frowned. "That sounds like a recipe for instability."

"Maybe." Mei smiled, and for the first time in centuries, it reached her eyes. "Or maybe it's a recipe for transcendence. We won't know until we try."

## IV. The Decision

They met at sunset, as they had a thousand times before.

Three legends. Three paths. Three reasons to teach again.

Wu wanted to remember joy.
Xu wanted to remember release.
Mei wanted to remember hope.

None of them spoke about what they were really looking for. They didn't need to. After millennia of friendship, some things went beyond words.

"The Selection is in three months," Wu said. "Noble families are already preparing their candidates. The usual parade of privilege and potential."

"We could choose from among them," Xu said. "As we always have."

"We could," Mei agreed. "But I don't think we will. Not this time."

Wu's smile turned genuine. "You felt it too."

"Something's different," she said. "I can't explain it. But when I think about the Selection, I don't see the candidates everyone expects us to choose. I see..." She trailed off, searching for words.

"Shadows," Xu finished quietly. "I see someone in the shadows. Watching. Waiting. Someone who shouldn't be there."

They looked at each other, three ancient powers sharing a moment of uncertainty. For all their knowledge, all their experience, all their millennia of wisdom, this was new. This feeling. This sense that something was about to change.

"We'll go to the Selection," Wu said finally. "We'll let the nobles perform their rituals and demonstrate their cultivation. And then we'll see what we actually find."

"And if it's a street orphan?" Mei asked. "Someone with no training, no resources, no connection to anything we know?"

Wu laughed—and this time, for the first time in longer than he could remember, the sound carried actual joy.

"Then we'll have found exactly what we're looking for."

---

*Three months later, they would stand before the gathered nobles of Xin Birch and reject every candidate presented to them. They would look into the shadows where no one else thought to look and see a boy who had never dared to dream of cultivation.*

*They would choose him. All three of them. Against all tradition, against all expectation, against everything the world believed possible.*

*And everything would change.*
