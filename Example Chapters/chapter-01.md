# Chapter 1: Streets of Xin Birch

---

Sonny ran.

Not from anything specific—not yet—but that was the trick of the streets. You ran *before* the specific thing appeared. You ran because standing still made you visible, and visible meant vulnerable, and vulnerable meant dead.

His feet knew the route without his mind's involvement. Sharp left at the fishmonger's. Vault over the broken cart that had been sitting in the alley since before he was born. Slide under the gap in old Peng's fence, where the wood had rotted just enough to admit a body as thin as his.

The morning market was hitting its stride, which meant chaos, which meant opportunity. Sonny slowed to a walk as he emerged into the crowd, letting the flow of bodies absorb him. Invisible again. Safe.

His hand drifted to the pouch at his belt. Still there. Still full.

Three meat buns, lifted from a vendor who'd been too busy shouting at a customer to notice the shadow at the edge of his stall. Warm through the thin fabric. His stomach cramped at the smell, but he didn't eat. Not yet. Not here.

Rule one: never eat what you steal where you stole it.

Rule two: never steal from the same place twice in a row.

Rule three: never, ever let them see your face.

The rules were survival, and survival was everything. Sonny had been surviving in Xin Birch since he was old enough to understand that no one else was going to do it for him.

---

He found a spot on a low wall near the eastern market, half-hidden by a cart selling winter melons. The vendor didn't notice him. No one noticed him. That was the whole point.

The first bun disappeared in three bites. The second he forced himself to eat slowly, savoring the meat, the dough, the simple miracle of not being hungry for a few more hours. The third he tucked away for later—if he didn't eat it, he could trade it, and trade meant options.

Options were almost as important as food.

From his perch, Sonny watched the market pulse with its daily rhythms. Merchants hawking. Customers haggling. Guards walking their routes, conspicuously armed, conspicuously bored. The same dance, every day, as predictable as the sun.

And above it all, occasionally, the cultivators.

They didn't walk through the market—they glided. Their robes were clean despite the dust, their posture perfect, their eyes fixed on something beyond the mortal crowd. When they passed, people moved aside without being asked. A wake of silence followed them, conversations dying and restarting as they went.

Sonny watched them the way a starving man watches a feast through a window.

He knew better than to stare. Staring got you noticed, and getting noticed by cultivators meant nothing good. But he couldn't help tracking them with his peripheral vision, cataloging their movements, their power, their *presence*.

They lived in a different world. A world of qi and cultivation and ascending hierarchies that had nothing to do with stolen meat buns and rooftop hideaways. Sometimes that world intersected with his—a cultivator walking through the market, a sect disciple buying supplies—but the intersection was always brief. They passed through his reality like ghosts, untouchable, unreachable.

*What would it feel like?* The thought came unbidden, as it sometimes did. *To have that kind of power? To walk through a crowd and know that nothing in it could hurt you?*

He crushed the thought before it could take root. Dreaming was dangerous. Dreaming made you slow. Dreaming got you killed.

Sonny finished his bun and dropped from the wall, disappearing back into the crowd.

---

The day passed the way days passed: in small victories and constant vigilance.

He scouted his usual routes, checking which vendors had changed positions, which guards were new, which alleys had been blocked or opened since yesterday. He verified his caches—the three hiding spots where he kept emergency supplies, scattered across the city in case one was discovered. He avoided the territory of the River Rats, the closest thing Xin Birch had to an organized gang, because he'd refused to join them last winter and they had long memories.

By afternoon, his feet hurt and his mind was tired from the constant calculation of threat and opportunity. He found a sunny spot on a rooftop—one of his regular perches, accessible only by a climb that would discourage pursuit—and let himself rest.

The city spread below him, a maze of rooftops and alleys he knew as intimately as his own heartbeat. Xin Birch wasn't beautiful. It was cramped and dirty and cruel. But it was his. He'd survived here when others hadn't. That had to count for something.

*Does it, though?*

The thought surfaced without warning, bringing with it a wave of something that felt dangerously like despair.

He'd been surviving for years. How many? He'd lost count. Street orphans didn't celebrate birthdays. But somewhere in the blur of hungry seasons and cold winters, he'd grown from a child into something approaching a man—and he was still here. Still stealing buns. Still hiding on rooftops. Still invisible.

*Is this it? Is this everything?*

He thought about the cultivators again. About the way they moved through the world, untouchable, powerful, *seen*. They existed in a way he didn't. They mattered.

*Stop it.*

He pushed himself up, shaking off the dark thoughts. This was stupid. Survival didn't leave room for philosophy. The cultivators lived in their world; he lived in his. The distance between those worlds was absolute, uncrossable, final.

Dreaming about it would only make the reality harder to bear.

---

The encounter happened near the textile district, in the hour before sunset when shadows stretched long and the crowds thinned.

Sonny was heading toward his evening hunting grounds when he saw the cultivator.

She was young—older than him, but not by much—and she walked with the absent confidence of someone who had never needed to check for threats. Her robes were silk, pale green, embroidered with patterns he couldn't identify. A sword hung at her hip, more ornament than weapon, its hilt wrapped in matching green cord.

She was talking to a merchant about some kind of fabric. Sonny gave her a wide berth, sliding to the opposite side of the street, making himself small and unremarkable.

He was almost past her when something flashed.

His hand moved before his mind caught up, snatching the object from the air where it had tumbled from her sleeve. Reflex. Pure survival instinct. Falling things meant opportunity.

He was three steps away before he realized what he was holding.

A pendant. Small, jade green, warm against his palm. And thrumming with something that made his fingers tingle.

*Qi.*

The pendant was infused with qi.

For one wild moment, Sonny thought about running. This was treasure—real treasure, the kind of thing that could buy him food for months, maybe years. The kind of thing that could change everything.

But even as the thought formed, he knew it was impossible.

This belonged to a cultivator. If he ran, she would notice. If she noticed, she would find him. If she found him, she would kill him—or worse, hand him to the city guards, who would make him wish she'd killed him.

There was no escape. Not from power like hers.

His feet carried him back toward her, moving without his permission. She was still talking to the merchant, still oblivious to what she'd dropped. Sonny approached from her blind side, heart hammering, every instinct screaming at him to flee.

He extended his hand. The pendant sat in his palm, catching the fading light.

"You dropped this," he said.

His voice came out rough, barely above a whisper. He didn't look at her face—couldn't look at her face. He just stood there, pendant extended, waiting for whatever came next.

The conversation with the merchant stopped.

For a moment, nothing happened. Sonny could feel her attention shifting toward him, and it was like standing in the sun after a lifetime in shadow. Burning. Unbearable.

Then her hand appeared in his field of vision. She took the pendant. Her fingers didn't touch his.

"Hm," she said.

That was it. That was everything. A single syllable, as if he'd handed her a piece of lint she'd forgotten she was carrying. Her attention shifted away, back to the merchant, and Sonny ceased to exist.

He stood there for another breath, two breaths, waiting for something more. Acknowledgment. Gratitude. Even anger would have been something.

Nothing came.

He walked away. No one stopped him. No one even looked at him.

He'd returned a cultivator's treasure, and she'd responded as if it had floated back to her hand on its own.

---

The rooftop was cold that night.

Sonny sat with his back against a chimney, wrapped in the thin blanket he'd stolen two winters ago, and tried not to think about what had happened.

*She didn't see me.*

The words kept circling, no matter how hard he tried to push them away.

*I was standing right there, and she didn't see me.*

It shouldn't hurt. He'd built his entire life around not being seen. Invisibility was survival. Invisibility was safety. He should be grateful that even a direct encounter with a cultivator had left no mark, no consequence, no ripple in his careful existence.

But something about the way she'd taken the pendant—casually, absently, as if receiving tribute from the empty air—had cracked something open in his chest.

He didn't exist. Not to people like her. Not to anyone, really. He was a shadow moving through a world that couldn't be bothered to notice him.

*Is this it?* The thought from earlier returned, sharper now. *Is this everything I'll ever be? A shadow? A nothing?*

The stars were coming out above Xin Birch, cold and distant. Sonny stared at them and felt the familiar weight of survival pressing down on him. Tomorrow there would be more stealing. More running. More careful calculation of threat and opportunity. The same dance, forever, until he got slow or unlucky or the winters finally won.

And then he'd be gone, and no one would notice that either.

He pulled the blanket tighter and closed his eyes, but sleep wouldn't come.

---

The rumors started three days later.

Sonny heard them first in the morning market, whispered between merchants with equal parts excitement and terror.

"Three of them. Three *legends*."

"Coming here? To Xin Birch?"

"For the Selection. They're choosing a student."

"Here? Why would they choose here?"

"Does it matter why? The noble families are already preparing. Every house with a son or daughter of age is sending candidates."

Sonny listened from his usual spot near the winter melon cart, his body still while his mind raced.

The Selection. He'd heard of it, vaguely—a tradition where powerful cultivators chose students from promising young nobles. It happened occasionally, in various cities, and it was always a massive event. Families invested fortunes in preparing their children. Entire dynasties rose or fell based on who was chosen.

But three legends? Here?

He drifted through the market, gathering fragments of conversation.

"—haven't taught anyone in centuries—"

"—turned down the Imperial Academy's candidates last time—"

"—they say one of them killed a dragon once—"

"—and another studied at the Jade Peak before it fell—"

"—no one knows what they're looking for—"

The names surfaced eventually, spoken with the reverent fear reserved for natural disasters and ancient powers.

Wu Liao. The Sword Saint. The Laughing Blade.

Mei Luo. The Alchemist of Sorrows. The Garden's Keeper.

Xu Sun. The Scholar of the Thousand Arrows. The Black Bow.

Sonny had never heard of any of them, but the reactions told him everything he needed to know. These weren't just cultivators. These were *legends*—figures from stories, myths made flesh, powers so vast that entire sects trembled at their passing.

And they were coming to Xin Birch.

*Why?*

The question nagged at him as he moved through his daily routines. The Selection made no sense. Xin Birch was a trading city, prosperous but unremarkable. Its noble families were wealthy, but they weren't known for producing exceptional cultivators. Why would three legends come here to choose a student?

*Does it matter?*

No. Of course it didn't matter. The Selection was for nobles, for families with resources and bloodlines and connections. It had nothing to do with him.

Nothing at all.

---

He told himself this for three days.

On the fourth day, he found himself on a rooftop overlooking the noble district, watching the preparations.

The great families had transformed their compounds into showcases of wealth and cultivation. Banners flew from every roof. Disciples practiced forms in courtyards visible from the street, their movements precise and powerful. Servants scurried everywhere, polishing, cleaning, arranging—creating the perfect stage for their young masters and mistresses to perform.

Sonny watched a boy about his own age execute a sword form in one of the courtyards. The movements were fluid, beautiful, backed by qi that shimmered visibly around the blade. This boy had probably been training since he could walk. Had probably never known hunger, or cold, or the gnawing uncertainty of not knowing where his next meal would come from.

*That could have been me.*

The thought was absurd. Dangerous. Stupid in ways he couldn't even articulate.

But it wouldn't go away.

Somewhere, in some other version of reality, Sonny had been born into a family like that. Had learned to cultivate as a child. Had grown up with power instead of just the dream of it.

In this reality, he'd grown up on the streets. He'd grown up stealing and running and surviving. He'd grown up invisible.

But somewhere, deep down, in a place he'd tried to bury so thoroughly he'd almost forgotten it existed—

*I want it.*

The admission hit him like a physical blow. He'd spent years telling himself not to dream, not to want, not to hope for anything beyond survival. And he'd believed it. He'd truly believed it.

But watching the noble boy execute his sword form, watching the qi shimmer around the blade, feeling the vast gulf between their worlds stretching wider with every moment—

Sonny wanted.

He wanted to be seen. To matter. To exist in a way that left marks on the world. He wanted to walk through a crowd and have people *notice*, to have power that meant something, to be more than a shadow waiting to be forgotten.

He wanted to fly.

The want was so huge, so impossible, so utterly beyond anything he could ever have, that for a moment he couldn't breathe. It pressed against his ribs like a living thing, demanding to be acknowledged after years of being denied.

Below, the noble boy finished his form. Servants applauded. Someone brought him water, a towel, a word of praise.

Sonny backed away from the edge of the roof, his hands shaking.

*Stop it,* he told himself. *Stop wanting. It's not for you. It's never been for you. The Selection is for nobles, for families, for people who matter. Not for street rats. Not for shadows.*

He fled back to his territory, heart pounding, lungs burning.

But the want didn't leave.

It stayed curled in his chest like a coal, smoldering, waiting.

Hidden beneath survival.

Ready to ignite.
